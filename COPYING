Towards a fully public domain system Nightshade is a set of patches onto a
stripped down version of CMUCL 18c.

All parts of CMUCL that are explicitly marked as copyrighted have been
removed from the source, including PCL, the CLX interface and the MIT
version of the loop macro.

The remaining copyrights are the implicit copyrights on additions made by
people since the original public domain release of CMUCL.  Some of these
have been explicitly dedicated to the public domain, and the following
authors have confirmed that the additions they made are public domain.

    Douglas Crosher     dtc
    Robert MacLachlan   ram
    Peter Van Eynde
    Paul Werkowski      pw

The intention for the rest of these additions is to either confirm that
they are public domain or replace them.
