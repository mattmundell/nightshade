As of version 1b Nightshade is most probably entirely public domain.  It is
based on CMUCL 18c.

All parts of CMUCL 18c that were explicitly marked as copyrighted have been
removed.  This includes PCL, the CLX interface, the MIT version of the loop
macro and some of the contrib directory.

Everyone who committed towards CMUCL 18c after the CMU public domain
release has confirmed that the additions they made are public domain.  They
are Douglas Crosher (dtc), Robert MacLachlan (ram) and Paul Werkowski (pw).

External contributions made towards CMUCL 18c after the CMU public domain
release were recorded in the logs.  The public domain status of these
additions falls into three categories:

	- Confirmed public domain by contributor
		  Peter Van Eynde, Fred Gilham, Eric Marsden, Timothy Miller,
		  Raymond Toy.

	- Reverted
		  Pierre Mai, Pierpaolo Bernardi.

	- Status pending
		  Marco Antoniotti, Casper Dik, Julian Dolby, Mike McDonald,
		  Tim Moore, Ken Olum.

Every new addition to the CMUCL 18c base is public domain.  A few of these
additions come from outside the Nightshade project, the sources of these
are detailed in the file etc/AUTHORS.
