Towards a fully public domain system Nightshade is a set of patches onto a
stripped down version of the CMUCL CVS of 2002-08-23 19:00 +0100.

Most parts of the CMUCL that are explicitly marked as copyrighted have been
taken out, including CLOS, the CLX interface and the MIT version of the
loop macro.  The little that is left over (parts of the docs) will follow.

The grey area is the additions made by people since the original public
domain release of CMUCL.  Some of these have been explicitly dedicated to
the public domain; the intention for the rest is to either confirm that
they are in the public domain or replace them.
