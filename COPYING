Towards a fully public domain system Nightshade is a set of patches onto a
stripped down version of CMUCL 18c.

All parts of CMUCL that are explicitly marked as copyrighted have been
removed from the source, including PCL, the CLX interface and the MIT
version of the loop macro.

What remains is the set of implicitly copyrighted additions made by people
since the original public domain release of CMUCL.  Some of these have been
explicitly dedicated to the public domain, and the following authors have
confirmed that the additions they made are public domain.

    pw     Paul Werkowski
    ram    Robert MacLachlan

The intention for the rest of these additions is to either confirm that
they are public domain or replace them.
