;;; Implementation specific character-hacking macros and constants.
;;;
;;; This file contains various constants and macros which are implementation or
;;; ASCII dependant.  It contains some versions of CHAR-CODE which do not check
;;; types and ignore the top bit so that various structures can be allocated
;;; 128 long instead of 256, and we don't get errors if a loser visits a binary
;;; file.
;;;
;;; There are so many different constants and macros implemented the same.
;;; This is to separate various mechanisms; for example, in principle the
;;; char-code-limit for the syntax functions is independant of that for the
;;; searching functions.
