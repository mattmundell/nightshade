;;; Structures used by constucts in the HEMLOCK package.

(in-package "ED")

;;; The server-info structure holds information about the connection to a
;;; particular eval server.  For now, we don't separate the background I/O and
;;; random compiler output.  The Notifications port and Terminal_IO will be the
;;; same identical object.  This separation in the interface may be just
;;; gratuitous pseudo-generality, but it doesn't hurt.
