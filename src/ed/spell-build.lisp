;;; This file contains code to build a new binary dictionary file from text
;;; in system space.  This code relies on implementation dependent code
;;; from spell-rt.lisp.  Also, it is expected that spell-corr.lisp and
;;; spell-aug.lisp have been loaded.  In order to compile this file, first
;;; compile spell-rt, spell-corr.lisp, and spell-aug.lisp.

;;; The text file must be in the following format:
;;;      entry1/flag1/flag2/flag3
;;;      entry2
;;;      entry3/flag1/flag2/flag3/flag4/flag5.
;;; The flags are single letter indicators of legal suffixes for the entry;
;;; the available flags and their correct use may be found at the beginning
;;; of spell-corr.lisp in the editor sources.  There must be exactly one
;;; entry per line, and each line must be flushleft.

;;; The dictionary is built in system space as three distinct
;;; blocks of memory: the dictionary which is a hash table whose elements
;;; are one machine word or of type '(unsigned-byte 16); a descriptors
;;; vector which is described below; and a string table.  After all the
;;; entries are read in from the text file, one large block of memory is
;;; validated, and the three structures are moved into it.  Then the file
;;; is written.  When the large block of memory is validated, enough
;;; memory is allocated to write the three vector such that they are page
;;; aligned.  This is important for the speed it allows in growing the
;;; "dictionary" when augmenting it from a user's text file (see
;;; spell-aug.lisp).

;;;; Constants

;;; This is an upper bound estimate of the number of stored entries in the
;;; dictionary.  It should not be more than 21,845 because the dictionary
;;; is a vector of type '(unsigned-byte 16), and the descriptors' vector
;;; for the entries uses three '(unsigned-byte 16) elements per descriptor
;;; unit.  See the beginning of Spell-Correct.Lisp.
