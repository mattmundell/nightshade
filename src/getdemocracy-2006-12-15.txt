Participatory Culture Foundation makes the open-source video RSS app,
Democracy Player - getdemocracy.com

We're looking for a top-notch programmer who can work independently,
communicate well, and occasionally step back from the code to
contemplate improvements to program architecture or our development
process. Most of our code is in dynamic languages like Python and
Ruby, so a clear understanding of language concepts is important.
Our developers are fans of Scheme and we think that someone who knows
Lisp / Scheme would make a good candidate for joining our
organization.

We are a new organization based in Worcester, MA but do not require
that the developer move to Worcester-- you may work remotely. This is
a full-time position working on Democracy Player related projects.

TO APPLY: Send a short note about why you're interested in working
with us along with a casual resume or description of what your
skills / experience is to jobs@pculture.org.
