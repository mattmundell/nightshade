;;;; Copying more args on call (known to be at least one more arg.)

;;; REALLY-COPY-MORE-ARGS -- Assembler Routine.
;;;
;;; This miscop has weird register usage conventions, since it is called at the
;;; very beginning of entry to a more-arg XEP.  All of the registers used
;;; by the full call convention are in use, and must not be trashed, but none
;;; of the normal local & temporary registers are in use, since we haven't done
;;; anything yet.  The number of fixed arguments is passed in a3, since we
;;; can't trash a0..a2.
;;;
;;; The VOP COPY-MORE-ARG has allocated some temporaries for us: a3, l0, l1.

;;; The registers we can use are NL1, A3, L0 and L1.  We save L2 and L3 to give
;;; us some more registers to work with.  The caller saves the function return
;;; PC in L2 (the now unused NAME) so that it can be used for the miscop return
;;; PC.
;;;
;;; What we do is fairly simple: we copy the incoming more arguments (index >=
;;; a3) onto the top of the stack.  The loop runs backwards, since we are
;;; copying args upward on the stack, and the source and destination can
;;; overlap.
;;;
;;; This loop terminates when we either run out of more args to copy or we run
;;; out of stack arguments.  If we run out of stack arguments before we finish,
;;; then there are register more args.  In this case, we dispatch off of the
;;; number of fixed arguments (A3) to determine how many argument registers to
;;; store.
