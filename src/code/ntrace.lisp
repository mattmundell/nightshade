(defmacro trace (&rest specs)
  "TRACE {Option Global-Value}* {Name {Option Value}*}*
   TRACE is a debugging tool that prints information when specified functions
   are called.  In its simplest form:
       (trace Name-1 Name-2 ...)

   TRACE causes a printout on *TRACE-OUTPUT* each time that one of the named
   functions is entered or returns (the Names are not evaluated.)  The output
   is indented according to the number of pending traced calls, and this trace
   depth is printed at the beginning of each line of output.

   Options allow modification of the default behavior.  Each option is a pair
   of an option keyword and a value form.  Options may be interspersed with
   function names.  Options only affect tracing of the function whose name they
   appear immediately after.  Global options are specified before the first
   name, and affect all functions traced by a given use of TRACE.

   The following options are defined:

   :CONDITION Form
   :CONDITION-AFTER Form
   :CONDITION-ALL Form
       If :CONDITION is specified, then TRACE does nothing unless Form
       evaluates to true at the time of the call.  :CONDITION-AFTER is
       similar, but suppresses the initial printout, and is tested when the
       function returns.  :CONDITION-ALL tries both before and after.

   :WHEREIN Names
       If specified, Names is a function name or list of names.  TRACE does
       nothing unless a call to one of those functions encloses the call to
       this function (i.e. it would appear in a backtrace.)  Anonymous
       functions have string names like \"DEFUN FOO\".

   :BREAK Form
   :BREAK-AFTER Form
   :BREAK-ALL Form
       If specified, and Form evaluates to true, then the debugger is invoked
       at the start of the function, at the end of the function, or both,
       according to the respective option.

   :PRINT Form
   :PRINT-AFTER Form
   :PRINT-ALL Form
       In addition to the usual prinout, the result of evaluating Form is
       printed at the start of the function, at the end of the function, or
       both, according to the respective option.  Multiple print options cause
       multiple values to be printed.

   :FUNCTION Function-Form
       This is a not really an option, but rather another way of specifying
       what function to trace.  The Function-Form is evaluated immediately,
       and the resulting function is traced.

   :ENCAPSULATE {:DEFAULT | T | NIL}
       If T, the tracing is done via encapsulation (redefining the function
       name) rather than by modifying the function.  :DEFAULT is the default,
       and means to use encapsulation for interpreted functions and funcallable
       instances, breakpoints otherwise.  When encapsulation is used, forms are
       *not* evaluated in the function's lexical environment, but DEBUG:ARG can
       still be used.

   :CONDITION, :BREAK and :PRINT forms are evaluated in the lexical environment
   of the called function; DEBUG:VAR and DEBUG:ARG can be used.  The -AFTER and
   -ALL forms are evaluated in the null environment."
