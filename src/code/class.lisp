;;;; Class definition structures:

;;; The LAYOUT structure is pointed to by the first cell of instance (or
;;; structure) objects.  It represents what we need to know for type checking
;;; and garbage collection.  Whenever a class is incompatibly redefined, a new
;;; layout is allocated.  If two object's layouts are EQ, then they are exactly
;;; the same type.
;;;
;;; LAYOUTs are treated specially by the dumper so that genesis can help us
;;; bootstrap the type system.  Only layouts for named classes can be dumped.
;;; This is resolved at load-time to the current layout for the class of that
;;; name --- except that genesis simply ensures that only one layout is
;;; allocated for each class (interns the layouts by name.)  Only the INHERITS,
;;; INHERITANCE-DEPTH and LENGTH slots are dumped.  In normal load, these slots
;;; had better agree with any current loaded value.  In cold load, these slots
;;; are used to create the LAYOUT if it doesn't exist yet (other slots left
;;; unitialized.)
