;;; Description: Simple profiling facility.
;;;
;;; Author: Skef Wholey, Rob MacLachlan
;;;
;;; Compatibility: Runs in any valid Common Lisp.  Three small implementation-
;;;   dependent changes can be made to improve performance and prettiness.
;;;
;;; Dependencies: The macro Quickly-Get-Time and the function
;;;   Required-Arguments should probably be tailored to the implementation for
;;;   the best results.  They will default to working, albeit inefficent, forms
;;;   in non-CMU implementations.  The Total-Consing macro is used to profile
;;;   consing: in unknown implementations 0 will be used.
;;;   See the "Implementation Parameters" section.
;;;
;;; Note: a timing overhead factor is computed when REPORT-TIME is first
;;; called.  This will be incorrect if profiling code is run in a different
;;; environment than the first call to REPORT-TIME.  For example, saving a core
;;; image on a high performance machine and running it on a low performance one
;;; will result in use of an erroneously small timing overhead factor.  In CMU
;;; CL, this cache is invalidated when a core is saved.
