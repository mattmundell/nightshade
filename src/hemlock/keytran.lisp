;;;; Keysym to character translation.

;;; Hemlock uses its own keysym to character translation since this is easier
;;; and more versatile than the CLX design.  Also, using CLX's mechanism is no
;;; more portable than writing our own translation based on the X11 protocol
;;; keysym specification.
;;;
;;; In the first table, nil indicates a non-event which is pertinent to
;;; ignoring modifier keys being pressed prior to pressing a key to be
;;; modified.  In the second table, nil simply indicates that there is no
;;; special shift translation for the keysym, and that the CLX shifted keysym
;;; should be looked up as normal (see TRANSLATE-CHARACTER).
;;;
;;; This mapping is initialized with DEFINE-KEYSYM in Keytrandefs.Lisp
