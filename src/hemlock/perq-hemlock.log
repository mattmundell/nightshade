/Lisp2/Slisp/Hemlock/perqsite.slisp#1, 23-Mar-85 11:05:16, Edit by Ram
  Made wait-for-more use logical-char=.

/lisp2/slisp/hemlock/echocoms.slisp#1, 22-Mar-85 13:41:10, Edit by Ram
  Made "Complete Keyword" and "Help on Parse" pass the parse default into
  Complete-File and Ambiguous-Files, respectively.

/Lisp2/Slisp/Hemlock/echocoms.slisp#1, 22-Mar-85 10:51:09, Edit by Ram
  Updated to correspond to new prompting conventions.

/Lisp2/Slisp/Hemlock/echo.slisp#1, 22-Mar-85 10:21:19, Edit by Ram
  Changes to make defaulting work better.  *parse-default* is now a string
  which we pretend we read when we confirm an empty parse.
  *parse-default-string* is now only used in displaying the default, as it
  should be.  The prompt and help can now be a list of format string and format
  arguments.  The feature of help being a function is gone.

/Lisp2/Slisp/Hemlock/echo.slisp#1, 22-Mar-85 08:00:01, Edit by Ram
  Made Parse-For-Something specify NIL to Recursive-Edit so that C-G's will
  blow away prompts.

/Lisp2/Slisp/Hemlock/buffer.slisp#1, 22-Mar-85 07:57:49, Edit by Ram
  Added the optional Handle-Abort argument to recursive-edit so that we can
  have recursive-edits that aren't blown away by C-G's.

/Lisp2/Slisp/Hemlock/spellcoms.slisp#1, 22-Mar-85 07:35:01, Edit by Ram
  Made Sub-Correct-Last-Misspelled-Word delete the marks pointing to misspelled
  words when it pops them off the ring.

/lisp2/slisp/hemlock/syntax.slisp#1, 18-Mar-85 07:20:53, Edit by Ram
  Fixed problem with the old value not being saved if a shadow-attribute was
  dowe for a mode that is currently active.

/lisp2/slisp/hemlock/defsyn.slisp#1, 14-Mar-85 09:42:53, Edit by Ram
  Made #\. be a word delimiter by default.  For old time's sake, it is not
  a delimiter in "Fundamental" mode.

/Lisp2/Slisp/Hemlock/filecoms.slisp#1, 13-Mar-85 00:25:19, Edit by Ram
  Changed write-da-file not to compare write dates if the file desn't exist.

/Lisp2/Slisp/Hemlock/perqsite.slisp#1, 13-Mar-85 00:15:31, Edit by Ram
  Changed emergency message stuff to divide the message size by 8.

/Lisp2/Slisp/Hemlock/htext2.slisp#1, 13-Mar-85 00:07:13, Edit by Ram
  Changed %set-next-character to use the body of Modifying-Buffer.  Made
  string-to-region give the region a disembodied buffer count.

/Lisp2/Slisp/Hemlock/htext3.slisp#1, 12-Mar-85 23:53:57, Edit by Ram
  Changed everyone to use the body of modifying-buffer.

/Lisp2/Slisp/Hemlock/htext1.slisp#1, 12-Mar-85 23:45:51, Edit by Ram
  Made Modifying-Buffer have a body and wrap a without-interrupts around the
  body.  Changed %set-line-string to run within the body of modifying-buffer.

/Lisp2/Slisp/Hemlock/echocoms.slisp#1, 12-Mar-85 23:28:40, Edit by Ram
  Made "Confirm Parse" push the input before calling the confirm function so
  that if it gets an error, you don't have to type it again.  Also changed it
  to directly return the default if there is empty input, rather than calling
  the confirm function on the default string.  It used to be this way, and I
  changed it, but don't remember why.

/Lisp2/Slisp/Hemlock/group.slisp#1, 12-Mar-85 23:10:43, Edit by Ram
  Made group-read-file go to the beginning of the buffer, which is useful in
  the case where the file was already read.

/Lisp2/Slisp/Hemlock/lispbuf.slisp#1, 12-Mar-85 22:58:03, Edit by Ram
  Made "Compile File" use buffer-default-pathname to get defaults for the
  prompt.  Added "Compile Group" command.

/lisp2/slisp/hemlock/kbdmac.slisp#1, 09-Mar-85 20:53:33, Edit by Ram
  Made default-kbdmac-transform bind *invoke-hook* so that recursive edits
  don't try do clever stuff.

/lisp2/slisp/hemlock/perqsite.slisp#1, 09-Mar-85 14:16:41, Edit by Ram
  Changed editor-input stream to use new stream representation.  Moved
  Input-Waiting here from Streams, changed definition to return T or NIL
  instead of number of chars.  Made Wait-For-More not unread the character if
  it is rubout.  Made level-1-abort handler clear input.

/lisp2/slisp/hemlock/streams.slisp#1, 09-Mar-85 14:59:02, Edit by Ram
  Changed to use new stream representation.

/lisp2/slisp/hemlock/pane-stream.slisp#1, 09-Mar-85 14:51:25, Edit by Ram
  Changed to use new stream representation.

/lisp2/slisp/hemlock/lispmode.slisp#1, 05-Mar-85 11:59:15, Edit by Ram
  Changed the "Defindent" command to go to the beginning of the line before
  doing the backward-up-list.  This means that we always find the form
  controlling indentation for the current line, rather than the enclosing form.
  Do a "Indent For Lisp" after we redefine the indentation, since it presumably
  changed.

/lisp2/slisp/hemlock/spell-corr.slisp#1, 05-Mar-85 11:39:19, Edit by Ram
  Fixed everyone to use gr-call.  Made Correct-Spelling call
  maybe-read-spell-dictionary, rather than trying to look at
  *spell-opeining-return*.

/lisp2/slisp/hemlock/spell-augment.slisp#1, 05-Mar-85 11:53:04, Edit by Ram
  Fixed everyone to use gr-call and friends.

/Lisp2/Slisp/Hemlock/command.slisp#1, 21-Feb-85 00:56:52, Edit by Ram
  Edited back in change to "Scroll Next Window ..." commands to make them
  complain if there is only one window.

/Lisp2/Slisp/Hemlock/filecoms.slisp#1, 21-Feb-85 00:48:00, Edit by Ram
  Edited back in changes:
    Make "Backup File" message the file written.
    Make Previous-Buffer return any buffer other than the current buffer
      and the echo area buffer it there is nothing good in the history.

/Lisp2/Slisp/Hemlock/bindings.slisp#1, 21-Feb-85 00:30:48, Edit by Ram
  Removed spurious binding of #\' to "Check Word Spelling".

/Lisp2/Boot/Hemlock/spellcoms.slisp#1, 05-Feb-85 13:58:54, Edit by Ram
  Added call to Region-To-String in "Add Word to Spelling Dictionary" so that
  it worked.

/Lisp2/Boot/Hemlock/fill.slisp#1, 31-Jan-85 12:09:01, Edit by Ram
  Made "Set Fill Prefix" and "Set Fill Column" define a buffer local variable
  so that the values are buffer local.

/Lisp2/Boot/Hemlock/fill.slisp#1, 26-Jan-85 17:19:57, Edit by Ram
  Made / be a paragraph delimiter.

/Lisp2/Boot/Hemlock/search2.slisp#1, 26-Jan-85 17:07:37, Edit by Ram
  Fixed the reclaim-function for set search patterns to reclaim the set instead
  of the search-pattern structure.

/Lisp2/Boot/Hemlock/group.slisp#1, 25-Jan-85 22:07:15, Edit by Ram 
  Changed the way Group-Read-File works.  We always use "Find File" to read in
  the file, but if "Group Find File" is false, and we created a new buffer, we
  rename the buffer to "Group Search", nuking any old buffer of that name.  If
  we are in the "Group Search" buffer when we finish, we nuke it and go to the
  previous buffer.

/Lisp2/Boot/Hemlock/macros.slisp#1, 25-Jan-85 22:35:26, Edit by Ram
  Fixed Hlet so that it worked.  Evidently nobody had used it before.  

/Lisp2/Boot/Hemlock/filecoms.slisp#1, 25-Jan-85 23:26:35, Edit by Ram
  Made "Log Change" merge the buffer pathname defaults into the log file name.
  Added the feature that the location for the point in the change log entry
  template can be specified by placing a "@" in the template.

/Lisp2/Boot/Hemlock/search2.slisp#1, 25-Jan-85 23:23:35, Edit by Ram
  Fixed various one-off errors in the end args being passed to position and
  %sp-find-character-with-attribute.
