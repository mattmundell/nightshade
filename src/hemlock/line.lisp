;;; This file contains definitions for the Line structure, and some 
;;; functions and macros to manipulate them.
;;;
;;;    This stuff was allowed to become implementation dependant because
;;; you make thousands of lines, so speed is real important.  In some
;;; implementations (the Perq for example) it may be desirable to 
;;; not actually cons the strings in the line objects until someone
;;; touches them, and just keep a pointer in the line to where the file 
;;; is mapped in memory.  Such lines are called "buffered".  This stuff
;;; links up with the file-reading stuff and the line-image building stuff.

  ;;
  ;; Something that represents the contents of the line.  This is
  ;; guaranteed to change (as compared by EQL) whenever the contents of the
  ;; line changes, but might at arbitarary other times.  There are
  ;; currently about three different cases:
  ;;
  ;; Normal:
  ;;    A simple string holding the contents of the line.
  ;;
  ;; A cached line:
  ;;    The line is eq to Open-Line, and the actual contents are in the
  ;;    line cache.  The %Chars may be either the original contents or a
  ;;    negative fixnum.
  ;;
  ;; A buffered line:
  ;;    The line hasn't been touched since it was read from a file, and the
  ;;    actual contents are in some system I/O area.  This is indicated by
  ;;    the Line-Buffered-P slot being true.  In buffered lines on the RT,
  ;;    the %Chars slot contains the system-area-pointer to the beginning
  ;;    of the characters.
  (%chars "")
  ;;
  ;; Pointers to the next and previous lines in the doubly linked list of
  ;; line structures.

  next
  ;;
  ;; A list of all the permanent marks pointing into this line.

  ;; The buffer to which this line belongs, or a *disembodied-buffer-count*
  ;; if the line is not in any buffer.
  %buffer
  ;;
  ;; A non-negative integer (fixnum) that represents the ordering of lines
  ;; within continguous range of lines (a buffer or disembuffered region).
  ;; The number of the Line-Next is guaranteed to be strictly greater than
  ;; our number, and the Line-Previous is guaranteed to be strictly less.

  ;; The line property list, used by user code to annotate the text.
