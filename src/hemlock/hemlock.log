.../systems-work/hemlock/mh.lisp, 18-Oct-90 13:41:38, Edit by Chiles.
  MAYBE-DELETE-EXTRA-DRAFT-WINDOW modified to correctly delete another window
  if one exists when a draft is a split window draft.  This had to be modified
  to handle separate, unstacked windows correctly.

.../systems-work/hemlock/bindings.lisp, 06-Sep-90 16:59:32, Edit by Chiles.
  We failed to avoid binding "Auto Check Word Spelling" to #k"'" when we added
  the new key-event stuff.  Actually, Blaine did.

.../systems-work/hemlock/bindings.lisp, 24-Aug-90 14:04:34, Edit by Chiles.
  Bound C-M-s (typically "Shell") to "Illegal" in the echo area.

.../systems-work/hemlock/bit-screen.lisp, 06-Aug-90 13:48:10, Edit by Chiles.
  I modified CREATE-WINDOW-FROM-CURRENT to correctly determin if there is
  enough room to split the current window to make the new window.

.../systems-work/hemlock/bit-screen.lisp, 06-Aug-90 12:59:40, Edit by Chiles.
  Made SET-WINDOW-HOOK-RAISE-FUN frob the windows group X window, instead of
  the child X window.

.../systems-work/hemlock/hunk-draw.lisp, 05-Aug-90 12:57:21, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed DROP-CURSOR to beat on the parent borders instead of the non-existent
  child borders.

.../systems-work/hemlock/bit-screen.lisp, 05-Aug-90 11:58:46, Edit by Chiles.
  Removed exports for MAKE-WINDOW, DELETE-WINDOW, NEXT-WINDOW, and
  PREVIOUS-WINDOW since they're in screen.lisp.

  Modified HUNK-RECONFIGURED to realize it object arg is either a hunk (for a
  child changing) or a window-group (for a group/parent window changing).

  Modified HUNK-MOUSE-ENTERED and HUNK-MOUSE-LEFT to frob the group window's
  border instead of the child's border.

  Totally redefined *create-window-hook* and *delete-window-hook*.  This
  affected most of the arrangement of creation and deletion functionality.

  Made the random-typeout window made from keeping a pop-up display, adhere to
  the minimum resizing parameters Hemlock windows like to try to keep users
  from screwing themselves.

  Made MAYBE-MAKE-X-WINDOW-AND-PARENT set window manager hints for supplied
  parents as if Hemlock had made the parent window.

  Made code correctly handle font-family parameters instead of dropping into
  lower-level code that incorrectly assumed *default-font-family*.

  Consolidated some code, notably MODIFY-PARENT-PROPERTIES.


.../systems-work/hemlock/xcoms.lisp, 01-Aug-90 14:00:43, Edit by Chiles.
  Blew away "Stack Window".

.../systems-work/hemlock/input.lisp, 01-Aug-90 13:49:27, Edit by Chiles.
  Blaine modified MAYBE-KEEP-RANDOM-TYPEOUT-WINDOW in accordance with the new
  bitmap window group stuff.

.../systems-work/hemlock/filecoms.lisp, 01-Aug-90 11:23:07, Edit by Chiles.
  Blaine modified "Delete Window" and "Delete Next Window" in accordance with
  the new bitmap window group stuff.  They now test the length of *window-list*
  to determine if they can delete the window instead of using next and previous
  window commands and primitives and testing against the CURRENT-WINDOW.

.../systems-work/hemlock/screen.lisp, 01-Aug-90 10:15:53, Edit by Chiles.
  Blaine modified DELETE-WINDOW to test for *window-list* having length two or
  less, signalling an error if so.  This allows the bitmap window deletion
  method to delete the current window by changing to another group.  The
  "Delete Window" command cannot tell there are other windows, and it already
  tries to make the previous window the current one before calling the
  DELETE-WINDOW primitive.  With the new bitmap window groups, this doesn't
  work.  We still have a problem if a programmer calls DELETE-WINDOW on the
  current window which will break Hemlock.

.../systems-work/hemlock/rompsite.lisp, 01-Aug-90 09:33:02, Edit by Chiles.
  Blaine modified the X events masks and the raising and lowering of Hemlock
  windows upon entering and leaving in accordance with the new bitmap window
  groups.

.../systems-work/hemlock/struct.lisp, 01-Aug-90 09:07:25, Edit by Chiles.
  Blaine added window-group structure and the window-group slot to
  bitmap-hunks for the new bitmap window groups.

.../systems-work/hemlock/keysym-defs.lisp, 04-Jul-90 12:14:09, Edit by Chiles.
  Added a few key-event to character translations at the end of the file to
  make quoting characters work better when running under X.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/diredcoms.lisp, 02-Jul-90 10:12:28, Edit by Mbb.
  Fixed a bug in "Dired" where it was incorrectly assuming that the current
  buffer was a DIRED buffer.

.../systems-work/hemlock/searchcoms.lisp, 27-Jun-90 18:27:38, Edit by Chiles.
.../systems-work/hemlock/kbdmac.lisp, 27-Jun-90 18:19:09, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed "Keyboard Macro Query" to realize the :bind arg to COMMAND-CASE is a
  key-event, not a charcter.

.../systems-work/hemlock/macros.lisp, 27-Jun-90 18:04:12, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed COMMAND-CASE to bind key-events, not characters.  It also doesn't make
  N calls to mapping functions everytime someone was to map one way or the
  other.  It also no longer makes erroneous assumptions about characters and
  key-events having a one-to-one mapping.

.../systems-work/hemlock/key-event.lisp, 27-Jun-90 17:34:57, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed bugs in character/key-event mapping that allowed bogus typed objects to
  fall through as if they mapped to meaningful values.

.../systems-work/hemlock/interp.lisp, 26-Jun-90 09:54:52, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed some documentation.

  Fixed a bug in KEY-TRANSLATION.  Someone changed a type-spec from '(or
  simple-vector null) to '(simple-vector null).

  Fixed a bug in TRANSLATE-KEY.  It returned the wrong thing and by accident
  didn't go into an infinite loop if there were any key translations to
  multiple key-event keys.


.../systems-work/hemlock/echo.lisp, 25-Jun-90 11:44:05, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed default prompt of PROMPT-FOR-KEY-EVENT to be "Key-event: ", not
  "Character: ".

.../systems-work/hemlock/interp.lisp, 24-Jun-90 12:28:02, Edit by Chiles.
  Removed silly KEYIFY definition, and I put Blaine's name on the file since he
  modified half of the contents to get the new key tables stuff to work.

.../systems-work/hemlock/input.lisp, 21-Jun-90 19:52:01, Edit by Chiles.
  Added doc strings to public routines.  Documented some code.  Moved some
  silly things around.

.../systems-work/hemlock/doccoms.lisp, 21-Jun-90 18:45:55, Edit by Chiles.
  Made COMMAND-CASE specify lowercase letters.

.../systems-work/hemlock/key-event.lisp, 20-Jun-90 23:11:18, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed a bug in TRANSLATE-KEY-EVENT.

.../systems-work/hemlock/bindings.lisp, 20-Jun-90 23:03:22, Edit by Chiles.
  Bound #k"H-t" to "Illegal" in the echo area.  This is normally bound to a
  command that makes the current window display the most recently used
  random-typeout buffer.

.../systems-work/hemlock/macros.lisp, 20-Jun-90 20:45:07, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed an extra paren bug that prevented successful compilation.  That's what
  I get for Blaine's failure to use "Extract Form".

.../systems-work/hemlock/lispmode.lisp, 20-Jun-90 20:47:57, Edit by Chiles.
  Added "Extract Form", a more useful and intuitive and consistent command to
  use instead of "Extract List" which is archaic, confusing, erroneously bound
  by default, and bound to old Lisp ideals that lists are something to focus
  on.

.../hemlock/ts-buf.lisp, 20-Jun-90 17:40:51, Edit by Wlott.
  Made typescript commands more robust in light of the possibility of being
  executed while in a buffer other than the slave buffer.

.../systems-work/hemlock/key-event.lisp, 20-Jun-90 17:00:33, Edit by Chiles.
  Totally rewrote mouse translation code.  Fixed multiple bugs MAKE-KEY-EVENT.

.../systems-work/hemlock/macros.lisp, 20-Jun-90 13:55:48, Edit by Chiles.
  Removed :character argument to COMMAND-CASE.  Stopped case-folding and
  eliminated variables used for that.

.../systems-work/hemlock/fill.lisp, 16-Jun-90 14:07:48, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed "Auto Fill Linefeed" and "Auto Fill Return" to use #k syntax instead of
  characters for keys.

.../systems-work/hemlock/key-event.lisp, 16-Jun-90 13:59:23, Edit by Chiles.
  Added missing exports.

  Fixed a couple bugs with DEFINE-KEY-EVENT-MODIFIER.  It was using EQL to
  compare strings.  Stuck an UNWIND-PROTECT in there to keep things consistent.
  Added restart for already defined modifiers allowing the user to go on
  blowing it off; this helps reloading the file.


.../systems-work/hemlock/echo.lisp, 16-Jun-90 11:11:17, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed two GET-KEY-EVENT calls to ignore abort attempts in PROMPT-FOR-KEY
  and PROMPT-FOR-KEY-EVENT.

.../systems-work/hemlock/keysym-defs.lisp, 15-Jun-90 18:17:38, Edit by Chiles.
  This file used to be called keytrandefs.lisp.

.../systems-work/hemlock/key-event.lisp, 15-Jun-90 18:34:10, Edit by Chiles.
  This file used to be called keytran.lisp.  It now implements key-events in
  the "EXTENSIONS" package.

.../systems-work/hemlock/bit-screen.lisp, 14-Jun-90 14:28:58, Edit by Chiles.
  Replaced calls to EXT:TRANSLATE-CHARACTER and EXT:TRANSLATE-MOUSE-CHARACTER
  with EXT:TRANSLATE-KEY-EVENT and EXT:TRANSLATE-MOUSE-KEY-EVENT.

.../systems-work/hemlock/shell.lisp, 15-Jun-90 16:27:42, Edit by Chiles.
  Picked up Blaine's new shell hacks and documented them.  Added "Current
  Shell" and "Ask about Old Shells" variables.  Changed "Shell" to be more like
  "Select Slave" and wrote "Shell Command Line in Buffer".

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/doccoms.lisp, 14-Jun-90 21:19:46, Edit by Mbb.
  Made a quoted list of #k mouse-keys be a call to LIST on the mouse-keys
  instead so they would get evaluated.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/input.lisp, 12-Jun-90 21:00:12, Edit by Mbb.
  input.lisp is a new file.  It contains code to implement input to
  hemlock.  Similar code previously resided in rompsite.lisp

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/icom.lisp, 12-Jun-90 16:15:00, Edit by Mbb.
/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/gosmacs.lisp, 12-Jun-90 16:15:00, Edit by Mbb.
  Changed BIND-KEY calls to use #k format instead of characters.

.../systems-work/hemlock/filecoms.lisp, 13-Jun-90 15:17:06, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote "Go to One Window" which makes a default initial window and deletes all
  other windows.  This is useful with losing window managers like twm, and it
  is useful in case you ever resize or move the main Hemlock window which
  happens by accident to some people.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/keytran.lisp, 13-Jun-90 14:01:58, Edit by Mbb.
  Changed all the BIND-KEY forms in this file to use #k format.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/files.lisp, 12-Jun-90 10:26:58, Edit by Mbb.
  Inserted the form (proclaim '(special vm_page_size)) so the compiler
  wouldn't whine about vm_page_size not being declared or bound. 

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/buffer.lisp, 11-Jun-90 11:58:39, Edit by Mbb.
  Modified DEFMODE -- The default mode-bindings slot is now a hash-table
  whereas it used to be a key-table.  Did the same for buffer-bindings in
  MAKE-BUFFER.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/keytrandefs.lisp, 11-Jun-90 13:17:59, Edit by Mbb.
  Made all calls to "EXTENSIONS" use an ext: prefix.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/scribe.lisp, 08-Jun-90 17:33:31, Edit by Mbb.
/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/register.lisp, 08-Jun-90 17:29:23, Edit by Mbb.
/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/interp.lisp, 08-Jun-90 17:27:44, Edit by Mbb.
  Changed all calls to PRINT-PRETTY-CHARACTER to calls to
  PRINT-PRETTY-KEY-EVENT. 

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/kbdmac.lisp, 08-Jun-90 17:25:50, Edit by Mbb.
  Made all calls to SUB-PRINT-KEY be calls to PRINT-PRETTY-KEY.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/doccoms.lisp, 08-Jun-90 17:15:46, Edit by Mbb.
  Removed SUB-PRINT-KEY in favor of PRINT-PRETTY-KEY.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/command.lisp, 08-Jun-90 14:36:12, Edit by Mbb.
  Changed all calls to TEXT-CHARACTER to calls to KEY-EVENT-CHAR.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/rompsite.lisp, 08-Jun-90 12:15:17, Edit by Mbb.
/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/termcap.lisp, 08-Jun-90 12:15:17, Edit by Mbb.
  Commented out CL-TERMCAP-CHAR as it is no longer needed.  
  GET-TERMCAP-STRING-CHAR does the conversion to a character now.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/doccoms.lisp, 08-Jun-90 11:08:09, Edit by Mbb.
  Removed from GET-MOUSE-COMMANDS a call to MAKE-CHAR in favor of
  MAKE-KEY-EVENT and also fixed a list to use the new #k"foo" format.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/bindings.lisp, 08-Jun-90 10:44:49, Edit by Mbb.
  Chnaged all bindings to #k"foo" format.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/charmacs.lisp, 07-Jun-90 14:44:36, Edit by Mbb.
  Removed the declaration of the constant all-bit-names, as bit names are
  no longer supported in Common Lisp.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/charmacs.lisp, 07-Jun-90 14:41:23, Edit by Mbb.
  Changed ALPHA-CHAR-LOOP and DO-ALPHA-CHARS to ALPHA-KEY-EVENTS-LOOP and
  DO-ALPHA-KEY-EVENTS respectively.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/tty-display.lisp, 06-Jun-90 10:38:07, Edit by Mbb.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/command.lisp, 05-Jun-90 15:02:21, Edit by Mbb.
  Fixed all references to *editor-input*.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/main.lisp, 06-Jun-90 10:07:41, Edit by Mbb.
  *editor-input* used to be exported from this file, event though it is
  also exported in input.lisp.  Removed export from main.lisp.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/rompsite.lisp, 05-Jun-90 14:31:55, Edit by Mbb.
  Changed reference to *character-history* in SITE-INIT to
  *key-event-history*.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/mh.lisp, 05-Jun-90 14:30:28, Edit by Mbb.
  Changed a reference to *character-history* to *key-event-history*.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/main.lisp, 05-Jun-90 14:27:23, Edit by Mbb.
  Removed export of *character-history* from this file in favor of putting
  it in input.lisp and changing the name to *key-event-history*.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/doccoms.lisp, 05-Jun-90 14:19:41, Edit by Mbb.
  Made "What Lossage" command reference *key-event-history* instead of
  *character-history*.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/streams.lisp, 05-Jun-90 14:10:43, Edit by Mbb.
  Made KBDMAC-GET use *last-key-event-typed* instead of
  *last-character-typed*.  Also changed stream definition of kbdmac-stream
  to coincide with the new editor-input like streams.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/spellcoms.lisp, 05-Jun-90 14:08:57, Edit by Mbb.
  Made SUB-CORRECT-LAST-MISSPELLED-WORD work with *last-key-event-typed*.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/scribe.lisp, 05-Jun-90 14:07:23, Edit by Mbb.
  Fixed "Scribe Insert bracket" to work with *last-key-event-typed*.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/rompsite.lisp, 05-Jun-90 13:59:46, Edit by Mbb.
  Removed all Input queue management and Random Typeout input routines and
  put them in a input.lisp, a new hemlock file.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/rompsite.lisp, 05-Jun-90 13:45:23, Edit by Mbb.
  Changed DEFVAR of *last-character-typed* to *last-key-event-typed*.  Also
  fixed setting of *last-character-typed* in DQ-EVENT.  For some reason,
  *last-character-typed* was exported from both main.lisp and
  rompsite.lisp.  This remains under the new name.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/overwrite.lisp, 05-Jun-90 13:43:23, Edit by Mbb.
  Made "Self Overwrite" use *last-key-event-typed* instead of
  *last-character-typed*.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/morecoms.lisp, 05-Jun-90 13:41:58, Edit by Mbb.
  Made "Self Insert Caps Lock" deal with *last-key-event-typed* instead of
  *last-character-typed*.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/main.lisp, 05-Jun-90 13:40:48, Edit by Mbb.
  Changed export of *last-character-typed* to *last-key-event-typed*.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/kbdmac.lisp, 05-Jun-90 13:37:38, Edit by Mbb.
  Made DEFAULT-KBDMAC-TRANSFORM and SELF-INSERT-KBDMAC-TRANSFORM use
  *last-key-event-typed* instead of *last-character-typed*.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/echocoms.lisp, 05-Jun-90 13:34:52, Edit by Mbb.
  Made "Complete Field" work with *last-key-event-typed*.
/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/completion.lisp, 05-Jun-90 13:28:07, Edit by Mbb.
  Made "Completion Self Insert" deal with *last-key-event-typed* instead of
  *last-character-typed*.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/command.lisp, 05-Jun-90 13:24:55, Edit by Mbb.
  Changed UNIVERSAL-ARGUMENT-LOOP to deal with *last-key-event-typed*
  instead of *last-character-typed*.  Also made "Self Insert" do the same.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/spellcoms.lisp, 05-Jun-90 12:58:02, Edit by Mbb.
  Changed calls to PROMPT-FOR-CHARACTER to calls to PROMPT-FOR-KEY-EVENT.
  Since what we wanted was the number of the correction choice, simply wrap
  a call to KEY-EVENT-CHAR around the PROMPT-FOR-KEY-EVENT.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/scribe.lisp, 05-Jun-90 11:59:46, Edit by Mbb.
  Made ADD-SCRIBE-DIRECTIVE and INSERT-SCRIBE-DIRECTIVE use PROMPT-FOR-KEY
  instead of PROMPT-FOR-CHARACTER.  They used to HASH on the result of
  PROMPT-FOR-CHARACTER, so key-events will work just as well.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/scribe.lisp, 05-Jun-90 11:59:46, Edit by Mbb.
  Changed all top-level ADD-SCRIBE-DIRECTIVE-COMMAND calls to use #k syntax
  when binding dispatches.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/struct.lisp, 05-Jun-90 11:08:20, Edit by Mbb.
  Changed DEFSETF for %SET-LOGICAL-CHAR= to %SET-LOGICAL-KEY-EVENT-P in
  order to maintain consistency.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/macros.lisp, 05-Jun-90 09:23:41, Edit by Mbb.
  Fixed COMMAND-CASE to bind key-events instead of characters.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/register.lisp, 05-Jun-90 09:31:41, Edit by Mbb.
  Made PROMPT-FOR-REGISTER return a key-event instead of a character.  The
  rest of the code code just hashes on what PROMPT-FOR-REGISTER returns, so
  since key-events are unique, nothing else had to be changed.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/keytrandefs.lisp, 04-Jun-90 13:16:13, Edit by Mbb.
  Completely changed this file to conform to new key syntax.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/charmacs.lisp, 04-Jun-90 13:10:55, Edit by Mbb.
  Removed all pushes into lisp::char-name-alist.

.../systems-work/hemlock/completion.lisp, 29-May-90 13:54:48, Edit by Chiles.
  Changed test in DO-COMPLETION to explicitly test for uppercase characters.
  Testing for lowercase characters caused ID's to be uppercased when they began
  with non-alphabetic characters (such as digit-chars).

.../systems-work/hemlock/bindings.lisp, 21-May-90 10:22:28, Edit by Chiles.
.../systems-work/hemlock/morecoms.lisp, 21-May-90 10:19:13, Edit by Chiles.
  Added "CAPS-LOCK" mode, "Caps Lock Mode" and "Caps Lock Self Insert".

  Added bindings for lowercase letters.


.../systems-work/hemlock/bindings.lisp, 21-May-90 10:14:10, Edit by Chiles.
.../systems-work/hemlock/diredcoms.lisp, 21-May-90 10:03:16, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote "Dired Up Directory" and added binding to #\^ in "Dired" mode.

.../systems-work/hemlock/diredcoms.lisp, 08-May-90 15:38:28, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed :help string in file prompt for "Delete File".

.../hemlock/ts-stream.lisp, 26-Apr-90 17:14:10, Edit by Wlott.
  Make %ts-stream-listen try calling server before finally saying that
  there is no more input available.

.../hemlock/files.lisp, 26-Apr-90 18:43:29, Edit by Wlott.
  Fixed a bug in write-file in which the first line was being extended with
  garbage if it didn't start at the first character.

.../systems-work/hemlock/lispeval.lisp, 16-Apr-90 14:03:10, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified OPERATION-STARTED, OPERATION-COMPLETED, and "List Operations" to
  preserve the case of context strings when MESSAGE'ing.  I added "The"'s to
  sentences which previously capitalized the first word of the context and
  lowered the remaining parts of the string.  I added periods to sentences in
  all these routines.  I stopped operation listing from forcing the entire
  string to lowercase.  The user should get his context as he supplied it.
  Many users complained about file names reporting as incorrect due to the old
  state of the code.

.../systems-work/hemlock/lispbuf.lisp, 16-Apr-90 13:41:05, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed doc string for "Current Package" in "package" file option handler.

/usr2/ch/lisp/lispeval.lisp, 15-Apr-90 19:14:38, Edit by Christopher Hoover.
  Sometimes the defined "Current Package" does not exist in the slave, and
  sometimes "Current Package" is defined as nil.  "Describe Function Call"
  points out which reason led to using the default package in the slave.

.../systems-work/hemlock/shell.lisp, 24-Mar-90 11:58:10, Edit by Chiles.
  New file.

.../systems-work/hemlock/bindings.lisp, 24-Mar-90 11:57:31, Edit by Chiles.
  Added bindings for new "Process" mode.

.../systems-work/hemlock/main.lisp, 22-Mar-90 16:03:27, Edit by Blaine.
  Added new hook "Buffer Writable Hook".

.../systems-work/hemlock/buffer.lisp, 22-Mar-90 15:45:51, Edit by Blaine.
  Write BUFFER-WRITABLE and %SET-BUFFER-WRITABLE.

.../systems-work/hemlock/struct.lisp, 22-Mar-90 15:40:31, Edit by Blaine.
  Renamed the writable slot to %writable.  Added DEFSETF for BUFFER-WRITABLE.

.../systems-work/hemlock/completion.lisp, 22-Mar-90 14:51:00, Edit by Chiles.
  Picked up Blaine's "Save Completions", "Read Completions", and "Parse Buffer
  for Completions".

  I added documentation to "Completion" mode and made the parameter
  completion-bucket-size-limit be a Hemlock variable "Completion Bucket Size".


.../systems-work/hemlock/buffer.lisp, 19-Mar-90 16:45:01, Edit by Chiles.
  Made the BUFFER-MODIFIED SETF'er return the value stored.

.../systems-work/hemlock/table.lisp, 12-Mar-90 12:43:13, Edit by Chiles.
  Made BI-SVPOSITION stop calling IDENTITY on every element.  There already was
  a test for the key argument being nil, but the author allowed the argument to
  default to IDENTITY.  Also, it is never called without a key argument anyway
  -- gratuitous generality maladjusted.

.../systems-work/hemlock/mh.lisp, 09-Mar-90 09:03:28, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed bug in REMAIL-MESSAGE resulting from recent changes to the environment
  code that made my MH env vars become capitalized when they should have been
  lowercase.

.../systems-work/hemlock/lispeval.lisp, 27-Feb-90 15:03:31, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified EVAL-FORM-IN-SERVER to optionally take a package name.  It uses the
  value of "Current Package" as a default, which it previously always supplied.
  EVAL-FORM-IN-SERVER-1 accordingly takes a package argument now.  "Describe
  Function Call" now first asks the server if the value of "Current Package"
  names a package, and if it does not, then this command describes the function
  call by reading the name into *package* in the slave.  This reasonably
  handles the problem of describing a function call with a buffer package that
  does not exist in the slave.

.../systems-work/hemlock/screen.lisp, 27-Feb-90 13:18:16, Edit by Mbb.
  Made pop-up displays better count lines when fully buffered.

.../systems-work/hemlock/lispeval.lisp, 22-Feb-90 11:20:03, Edit by Chiles.
  Picked up Williams change to "Lisp Operations", and I documented his peculiar
  queue implementation.

.../systems-work/hemlock/srccom.lisp, 21-Feb-90 13:52:45, Edit by Chiles.
  Added "Source Compare Ignore Indentation" and wrote a macro to generate the
  line comparison routines that *srccom-line-=* holds.

.../systems-work/hemlock/searchcoms.lisp, 15-Feb-90 10:17:40, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed a bug in undo'ing replacements.  IF two were immediately adjacent, the
  second would not be undone.

.../systems-work/hemlock/command.lisp, 14-Feb-90 14:15:38, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed "Forward Character".

.../systems-work/hemlock/eval-server.lisp, 10-Feb-90 12:07:29, Edit by Chiles.
  Made editor MESSAGE what slave is GC'ing when dumping GC messages behind the
  prompt.  Also, moved the global frobbing into the two routines that setup and
  cleanup stream variables.

.../systems-work/hemlock/mh.lisp, 09-Feb-90 17:02:43, Edit by Chiles.
  Finally fixed bug in PICK-MESSAGES that allowed MH pick to screw us.  MH pick
  would output "0" when no messages matched a specification, so PICK-MESSAGES
  now tests the result of calling MH to invoke "pick".  It returns nil whenever
  MH returns other than t for correct completion.

.../systems-work/hemlock/termcap.lisp, 08-Feb-90 20:07:01, Edit by Chiles.
  The new fd-streams, which correctly implement unreading characters, pointed
  out that this code relied on multiply unreading characters.  It no longer
  does.

.../systems-work/hemlock/lisp-lib.lisp, 07-Feb-90 15:50:50, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified MERGE-PATHNAMES calls that used strings with dots to merge in types.
  This no longer works with the new NAMESTRING/PARSE-NAMESTRING stuff.

.../systems-work/hemlock/command.lisp, 07-Feb-90 13:52:10, Edit by Chiles.
  "Next Line" was opening newlines in the middle of the buffer's last line of
  text when the buffer wasn't newline terminated.

/usr2/mbb/lisp/work/macros.lisp, 07-Feb-90 12:22:54, Edit by Mbb.
  Changed how WITH-POP-UP-DISPLAY determines whether to cleanup.  It 
  shouldn't have been cleaning up unless something had really happened, but
  it was.

.../systems-work/hemlock/files.lisp, 31-Jan-90 11:58:15, Edit by Chiles.
  Modifed all occurrances of "fdstream" to "fd-stream" to be consistent with
  new interface.

.../systems-work/hemlock/mh.lisp, 26-Jan-90 12:41:47, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed bug leaving a file open every time I called MH-PROFILE-COMPONENT, and
  closed the process in MH.

.../systems-work/hemlock/command.lisp, 24-Jan-90 11:06:13, Edit by Chiles.
  Changed "Next Line", "Previous Line", "Next Word", "Previous Word",
  "Forward Character", "Backward Character", "Delete Next Character", and
  "Delete Previous Character" to work with correctly negative arguments.

.../systems-work/hemlock/macros.lisp, 24-Jan-90 10:40:00, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified WITH-POP-UP-DISPLAY to have a doc string other than "Do Some Shit."

.../systems-work/hemlock/lispbuf.lisp, 22-Jan-90 15:17:49, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified code around *prompt* to adhere to new semantics of its values.

.../hemlock/mh.lisp, 19-Jan-90 21:00:28, Edit by Wlott.
  Changed to use new RUN-PROGRAM return values.

.../systems-work/hemlock/eval-server.lisp, 19-Jan-90 12:07:06, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified DO-OPERATION and the thing that aborts operations to handshake on
  whether we were in the debugger when we aborted.  If we were, output a
  message trying to inform the user that the output in his typescript can be
  ignored; he is no longer really in the debugger.

.../systems-work/hemlock/lispeval.lisp, 18-Jan-90 23:21:55, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed "Abort Operations" to really abort the operations (one more time).

.../systems-work/hemlock/eval-server.lisp, 18-Jan-90 16:45:24, Edit by Chiles.
  Made the -slave switch handler setup *gc-notify-before* and *gc-notify-after*
  to do gratuitous output to the editor.

.../systems-work/hemlock/ts-stream.lisp, 18-Jan-90 16:08:00, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed a bug in WAIT-FOR-TYPESCRIPT-INPUT that incorrectly reported input when
  the function was re-entered by handling an event in SERVE-EVENT.

.../systems-work/hemlock/ts-buf.lisp, 18-Jan-90 12:14:40, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified TS-BUFFER-OUTPUT-STRING to take a gratuitous-p optional indicating
  output should go behind the prompt.

.../systems-work/hemlock/morecoms.lisp, 17-Jan-90 21:21:53, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified DO-RECURSIVE-EDIT to update the modeline field before possibly
  signalling an error in the cleanup forms of the UNWIND-PROTECT.

.../systems-work/hemlock/ts-buf.lisp, 17-Jan-90 15:25:18, Edit by Chiles.
  Removed weird disappearing prompt stuff.  Added stuff to help users unwedge
  themselves when they get behind the prompt.

.../systems-work/hemlock/streams.lisp, 16-Jan-90 13:42:19, Edit by William.
  Made Hemlock output streams make sure the mark is :left-inserting, but only
  when actually doing the output.

.../systems-work/hemlock/morecoms.lisp, 15-Jan-90 09:07:31, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified "Count Lines" and "Count Words" to report lines counted as being in
  the active region or after the point.

.../systems-work/hemlock/eval-server.lisp, 15-Jan-90 13:09:19, Edit by Wlott.
  Changed occurances of SYSTEM:SERVER to SYSTEM:SERVE-EVENT.

  Added tweeking of *standard-output* and friends in addition to
  *terminal-io* when connecting to a slave.


.../systems-work/hemlock/lispeval.lisp, 15-Jan-90 14:13:56, Edit by Wlott.
  Made FILE-COMPILE pay attention to "Remote Compile File". (I must have been
  brain-dead the first time through that code...)

.../systems-work/hemlock/files.lisp, 15-Jan-90 15:21:36, Edit by Wlott.
  Changed write-file to be faster.

.../systems-work/hemlock/srccom.lisp, 13-Jan-90 14:42:07, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Merge Buffers" have an (A)lign window with start of difference display
  option in the command loop.  I often had to use recursive edit to be able to
  position the window to see the difference that was otherwise not visible due
  to normal scrolling and redisplay centering the mark.

.../systems-work/hemlock/srccom.lisp, 13-Jan-90 14:00:25, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed "Compare Buffers" and "Merge Buffers" to test for a nil result when
  calling LINE-OFFSET.  When buffers weren't terminated with newlines, the old
  code would infinitely loop.

.../systems-work/hemlock/lispmode.lisp, 12-Jan-90 18:29:20, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified SCAN-DIRECTION-VALID to check for the ignore region falling off the
  end of the line which caused %FORM-OFFSET to infinitely loop.

.../systems-work/hemlock/ts-stream.lisp, 12-Jan-90 12:47:37, Edit by Wlott.
  Changed occurances of SYSTEM:SERVER to SYSTEM:SERVE-EVENT.

.../systems-work/hemlock/tty-disp-rt.lisp, 11-Jan-90 19:31:46, Edit by Wlott.
  Changed to work with fdstreams.

.../systems-work/hemlock/rompsite.lisp, 11-Jan-90 16:42:02, Edit by Wlott.
  Changed occurances of SYSTEM:SERVER to SYSTEM:SERVE-EVENT.

.../systems-work/hemlock/tty-screen.lisp, 09-Jan-90 14:27:17, Edit by Chiles.
  When we make a random typeout window, we no longer say the screen image is
  trashed.  Some uses of pop up displays do output and then prompt inside the
  form, and this prompting was causing the main window to be redisplayed since
  we said the screen image was trashed.  This drew over our pop up display.

.../systems-work/hemlock/indent.lisp, 08-Jan-90 10:20:48, Edit by Mbb.
  Made "Center Line" use the active region.

.../systems-work/hemlock/bit-screen.lisp, 05-Jan-90 17:07:23, Edit by Mbb.
  REVERSE-VIDEO-HOOK-FUN was calling the wrong function.

.../systems-work/hemlock/eval-server.lisp, 01-Dec-89 17:58:53, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed a bug in SERVER-DIED that prevented it from deleting variables
  referencing dead server-infos.

.../systems-work/hemlock/ts-buf.lisp, 01-Dec-89 17:06:22, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified and documented TYPESCRIPTIFY-BUFFER to make a local "Current Eval
  Server" variable.

.../systems-work/hemlock/eval-server.lisp, 01-Dec-89 16:29:25, Edit by Chiles.
  GET-CURRENT-EVAL-SERVER cleaned up.  "Select Slave" rewritten to no longer
  set current eval server.

.../systems-work/hemlock/eval-server.lisp, 22-Nov-89 15:51:42, Edit by Mbb.
  Just someone forgetting the result argument to THROW.  The old defmacro
  compiler stuff didn't catch this, so it used to pass (and amazingly, work).

.../systems-work/hemlock/morecoms.lisp, 22-Nov-89 15:31:29, Edit by Mbb.
  Somehow, the old "Count Lines" worked.  How, I don't know.  It had an IF
  without a THEN clause, which is required by ClTM.  The new DEFMACRO stuff
  caught it.

.../systems-work/hemlock/mh.lisp, 27-Oct-89 11:49:25, Edit by Chiles.
  After recently eliminating recursive folder support, "List Folders" continued
  to claim it would list all folders recursively.  Removed useless code and
  bogus doc string.

.../systems-work/hemlock/diredcoms.lisp, 25-Oct-89 16:15:29, Edit by Chiles.
  Picked up Blaine's changes to make "Dired" and "Dired with Pattern" do dot
  files with an argument.  This propagates to subdirectories.

.../systems-work/hemlock/lisp-lib.lisp, 25-Oct-89 15:59:19, Edit by Chiles.
  Made browser look in new library location.

.../systems-work/hemlock/lispeval.lisp, 29-Sep-89 15:52:50, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed a bug in "Abort Operations" and documented how it works.

.../systems-work/hemlock/mh.lisp, 28-Sep-89 15:37:39, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified "Headers Delete Message" to be prepared to deal with a list of
  message ID's when in a message buffer.

.../systems-work/hemlock/eval-server.lisp, 22-Sep-89 11:28:02, Edit by Chiles.
  Made SERVER-COMPILE-TEXT do a TERPRI on error-output since the background
  buffer was incredibly hard to read when compiling single defuns.

.../systems-work/hemlock/rompsite.lisp, 20-Sep-89 00:39:06, Edit by Chiles.
  Installed WITHOUT-HEMLOCK from code:lispinit.lisp.  This had to be part of
  Hemlock, as it should have been, so expansions of it during compilation of
  Hemlock would no longer cause hardwired references to bogus "OLD-HI" symbols.

.../systems-work/hemlock/doccoms.lisp, 19-Sep-89 20:15:26, Edit by Chiles.
.../clisp-1/systems-work/hemlock/echo.lisp, 19-Sep-89 20:06:56, Edit by Chiles.
  Replaced ~C FORMAT directives with ~:C to adhere to new standard.

/usr2/ch/lisp/echocoms.lisp, 11-Sep-89 21:21:46, Edit by Christopher Hoover.
  Made "Complete Field" and "Complete Keyword" do the same thing for
  parse types of :file.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/searchcoms.lisp, 18-Sep-89 12:56:33, Edit by Chiles.
  When we fixed QUERY-REPLACE-LOOP to use a permanent marker for the end mark,
  we destroyed the current region effect when the current mark was before the
  current point.  I fixed this to be a permanent mark that is a copy of the end
  mark of the region within which we replace things.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/mh.lisp, 15-Sep-89 11:30:56, Edit by Chiles.
  Blew away "-recurse" from CHECK-FOLDER-NAME-TABLE.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/macros.lisp, 14-Sep-89 12:18:47, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed bug in DO-STRINGS introduced with the new string table stuff a few
  months ago.  It spliced the result form after a DOTIMES instead inside it, so
  RETURN's inside the DO-STRING's returned the result form instead of the
  returned values.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/ts-stream.lisp, 13-Sep-89 19:07:27, Edit by Wlott.
  Fixed bug in %TS-STREAM-SOUT that caused the character position to become
  confused.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/lispeval.lisp, 08-Sep-89 11:59:16, Edit by Chiles.
  Changed "Forget Compiler ..." to "Flush ...".

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/diredcoms.lisp, 03-Sep-89 17:39:07, Edit by Chiles.
  Stopped DIRED-DOWN-LINE from moving the mark to the beginning of the line.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/macros.lisp, 01-Sep-89 10:50:03, Edit by Chiles.
  Proclaimed *buffer-names* special.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/rompsite.lisp, 27-Aug-89 12:26:44, Edit by Chiles.
  Removed BUILD-HEMLOCK.  Created load-hem.lisp.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 25-Aug-89 11:17:01, Edit by Chiles.
  Added LOAD's for new TCP/eval server files.

  Removed old eval server stuff.


/usr1/lisp/nhem/eval-server.lisp, 25-Aug-89 11:16:29, Edit by Chiles.
  This is a new file.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/ts-stream.lisp, 25-Aug-89 09:56:46, Edit by Chiles.
  This is a new file.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/ts.lisp, 24-Aug-89 16:35:30, Edit by Chiles.
  Basically a new file for interfacing to the new typescript streams.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 24-Aug-89 16:16:25, Edit by Chiles.
  This is effectively a new file for use with TCP eval servers.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispbuf.lisp, 24-Aug-89 16:07:34, Edit by Chiles.
  Added "Editor" mode to this file.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/edit-defs.lisp, 24-Aug-89 15:57:28, Edit by Chiles.
  Updated definition fetching code to use DO-EVAL-FORM instead of
  EVAL_FORM-IN-CLIENT.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/echo.lisp, 24-Aug-89 15:54:00, Edit by Chiles.
  Moved LOUD-MESSAGE here from lispeval.lisp and exported it.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 24-Aug-89 15:51:31, Edit by Chiles.
  Commented out binding for "Abort Typescript Input".

  Added bindings for "Next Compiler Error" and "Previous Compiler Error".

  Changed some names "Process Control ..." to "Typescript Slave ...".


/usr1/lisp/hemlock/struct.lisp, 16-Aug-89 15:09:14, Edit by Chiles.
  Removed
     (:print-function ...)
  forms for structures that included another structure and explicitly
  specified the included functions print fucntion.  It is now in the standard
  and our system that these should automatically be inherited.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bit-screen.lisp, 28-Jul-89 14:42:20, Edit by Chiles.
  Blaine fixed his fix to the "Reverse Video" hook for the new pop-up displays.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/morecoms.lisp, 28-Jul-89 13:45:33, Edit by Chiles.
  Restored old definition of "Capitalize Word" and made it loop until it finds
  the first alphabetic character in the word instead of assuming the first
  character is capitalizable.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/filecoms.lisp, 27-Jul-89 10:09:56, Edit by Chiles.
  Blaine made "Log Change" check that the initial buffer still exists before
  going to it.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/command.lisp, 26-Jul-89 17:49:32, Edit by Chiles.
  Rewrote "Universal Argument", "Argument Digit", "Negative Argument".  This
  fixes the bug M-- M-1 M-2 yielding -8 instead of -12.  Now "Universal
  Argument" strips bits off every character it reads, and it no longer goes
  through the command loop on repeated C-U input.  The other two commands
  basically setup to jump into "Universal Argument".  This means to things:
     1] You no longer can type minus signs after every C-u.
     2] When typing digits, you cannot invoke any commands bound to
        a first digit with modifier bits.  This should be no big deal.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/syntax.lisp, 14-Jul-89 15:26:51, Edit by Chiles.
/usr1/lisp/hemlock/buffer.lisp, 14-Jul-89 15:17:25, Edit by Chiles.
/usr1/lisp/hemlock/vars.lisp, 14-Jul-89 14:31:34, Edit by Chiles.
/usr1/lisp/hemlock/main.lisp, 14-Jul-89 14:33:27, Edit by Chiles.
  Moved *global-variable-names* back to main.lisp from vars.lisp since vars is
  loaded before table.lisp which defines MAKE-STRING-TABLE.

  Moved *buffer-names* and *mode-names* back to main.lisp for above reason.

  *command-names* from interp.

  *character-attribute-names from syntax.


/usr1/lisp/nhem/font.lisp, 11-Jul-89 15:49:59, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified NEW-FONT-MARK to terminate a loop correctly and to stop calling
  DIS-LINE-LINE on nil.

/../victoria/usr2/lisp/hemlock/bit-screen.lisp, 09-Jul-89 15:51:46, Edit by Mbb.
  Made REVERSE-VIDEO-HOOK-FUN do the right thing for random typeout
  windows.  I, uhhhh.., kind of missed this.

  Removed an extraneaous variable binding that was causing a "Bound but not
  referenced error."


/usr1/lisp/nhem/completion.lisp, 07-Jul-89 13:00:47, Edit by Chiles.
  #\' is no longer a completion-wordchar in "Lisp" mode.  Just an oversight.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/rompsite.lisp, 07-Jul-89 16:18:51, Edit by Mbb.
  Replaced call to INVOKE-HOOK with DOLIST since this is compiled before
  macros.lisp, analogous to using VARIABLE-VALUE instead of VALUE.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/htext1.lisp, 07-Jul-89 16:06:08, Edit by Mbb.
/usr/lisp/hemlock/htext4.lisp, 07-Jul-89 16:06:08, Edit by Mbb.
  Frobbed MOVE-SOME-MARKS in htext1.lisp to allow declarations within the
  body.  Added declarations using this macro in htext4.  Also gratuitously
  changed the indentation in htext4 of MOVE-SOME-MARKS (To screw file
  comparison.)

/usr/lisp/hemlock/tty-screen.lisp, 07-Jul-89 14:29:53, Edit by Mbb.
  Renamed MAKE-DEVICE to MAKE-TTY-DEVICE.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/struct.lisp, 07-Jul-89 14:19:16, Edit by Mbb.
/usr/lisp/hemlock/bit-display.lisp, 07-Jul-89 14:15:42, Edit by Mbb.
/usr/lisp/hemlock/tty-display.lisp, 07-Jul-89 14:20:47, Edit by Mbb.
  Moved device and hunk stuff into struct.lisp.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/echo.lisp, 07-Jul-89 11:19:23, Edit by Mbb.
  Made PROMPTING-MERGE-PATHNAMES work.  It used to choke if
  pathname-defaults was NIL.

  Moved definition of hemlock-eof from main.lisp to echo.lisp, where it
  belongs.


/usr/lisp/hemlock/rompsite.lisp, 06-Jul-89 16:20:13, Edit by Mbb.
  Moved constant definition of font-map-size from font.lisp to
  rompsite.lisp because SETUP-FONT-FAMILY assumed that it was a special.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/rompsite.lisp, 06-Jul-89 13:21:21, Edit by Mbb.
  Moved definitions of *editor-input*, *last-character-typed*, and
  *character-history* from main.lisp to rompsite.lisp, where they belong,
  and exported them.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/window.lisp, 06-Jul-89 13:16:55, Edit by Mbb.
  Moved definitions of *current-window* and *window-list* from main.lisp to
  window.lisp, exporting *window-list*.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/interp.lisp, 06-Jul-89 13:09:29, Edit by Mbb.
  Moved definitions of *command-names*, *prefix-argument-supplied*, and
  *prefix-argument* from main.lisp to interp.lisp, exporting *command-names*.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/buffer.lisp, 06-Jul-89 12:59:36, Edit by Mbb.
  Moved definitions of *buffer-names*, *buffer-list*, *current-buffer*, and
  *mode-names* from main.lisp to buffer.lisp, exporting all but
  *current-buffer*.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/vars.lisp, 06-Jul-89 12:09:46, Edit by Mbb.
  Moved definition of *global-variable-names* from main.lisp to vars.lisp,
  where it belongs, and exported it.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/syntax.lisp, 06-Jul-89 11:57:48, Edit by Mbb.
  Moved *last-character-attibute-requested*, *character-attribute-names*,
  *value-of-last-character-attribute-requested*, and *character-attributes*
  from main.lisp to syntax.lisp, exporting *character-attribute-names*.

  Proclaimed the following variables special:
  (*mode-names* *current-buffer* *last-character-attribute-requested*

/usr/lisp/hemlock/struct.lisp, 06-Jul-89 11:48:59, Edit by Mbb.
  Removed definitions of now-tick and TICK and put them in htext1.lisp,

/usr/lisp/hemlock/lispeval.lisp, 05-Jul-89 15:42:36, Edit by Mbb.
  Created this file for structures that are only used in the HEMLOCK
  package.  Moved SERVER-INFO structure from lispeval.lisp to this file.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/rompsite.lisp, 05-Jul-89 15:34:21, Edit by Mbb.
  Moved the package initialization stuff from rompsite.lisp to ctw.lisp, as
  this is where it should be.

/usr2/lisp/hemlock/pop-up-stream.lisp, 05-Jul-89 14:07:55, Edit by Mbb.
/usr2/lisp/hemlock/struct.lisp, 05-Jul-89 14:07:55, Edit by Mbb.
  Moved the POP-UP-STREAM structure to struct.lisp.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/work/screen.lisp, 03-Jul-89 17:05:58, Edit by Mbb.
  Made RANDOM-TYPEOUT-CLEANUP clean up the modeline field instead of doing
  it in both the tty and bitmap cleanup methods.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/work/pop-up-stream.lisp, 03-Jul-89 15:53:13, Edit by Mbb.
  Made misc methods for line-buffered and full-buffered streams distinct.
  FORCE-OUTPUT and FINISH-OUTPUT are now no-ops for full-buffered streams.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/work/macros.lisp, 03-Jul-89 15:43:19, Edit by Mbb.
  Made GET-RANDOM-TYPEOUT-INFO assign distinct misc methods to
  full-buffered and line-buffered random-typeout streams.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/window.lisp, 02-Jul-89 15:54:40, Edit by Chiles.
  Added "Maximum Modeline Pathname Length" which defaults to nil.  Wrote
  BUFFER-PATHNAME-ML-FIELD-FUN.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/morecoms.lisp, 02-Jul-89 16:09:45, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Defhvar" propagate any existing hooks as well.

  Replaced occurrences of

/usr1/lisp/nhem/vars.lisp, 02-Jul-89 14:30:55, Edit by Chiles.
  Deleted function definition for INVOKE-HOOK.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/macros.lisp, 02-Jul-89 13:45:37, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote macro INVOKE-HOOK that replaces INVOKE-HOOK* and is exported.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bit-screen.lisp, 29-Jun-89 11:26:19, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed INIT-BITMAP-DEVICE to drop any pending events on the floor, so
  accidental input while not in Hemlock is ignored.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 29-Jun-89 10:54:17, Edit by Chiles.
  Made default value for "Remote Compile File" be nil.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/window.lisp, 29-Jun-89 10:43:26, Edit by Chiles.
  Moved the :modifiedp modeline-field to be between the modes and buffer name.
  Modified the :modifiedp and :buffer-pathname update functions accordingly.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/macros.lisp, 29-Jun-89 10:12:25, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed GET-RANDOM-TYPEOUT-INFO: it now supplies "Fundamental" only for the
  random typeout buffer's modes, and the delete hook is now a compiled function
  instead of interpreted.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/pop-up-stream.lisp, 28-Jun-89 16:41:56, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed a bug in RANDOM-TYPEOUT-MISC that called redisplay on the pop-up window
  when it didn't exist.  When the stream is full-buffered, and no previous
  random typeout has occurred for a given buffer, the window slot in the stream
  is nil.  This should be fixed better than I have done.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispmode.lisp, 28-Jun-89 16:38:40, Edit by Chiles.
  Added DEFINDENT for WITH-POP-UP-DISPLAY.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/work/bit-screen.lisp, 22-Jun-89 20:11:59, Edit by Mbb.
  The device dependant random-typeout-cleanup methods were fixing up the
  modeline, but this is device independant, so I moved it to screen.lisp.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/work/screen.lisp, 22-Jun-89 19:58:08, Edit by Mbb.
  RANDOM-TYPEOUT-CLEANUP now sets the Random Typeout buffer's modeline
  field to :normal.  Before it lost on a Keep character in a more.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/work/pop-up-stream.lisp, 22-Jun-89 19:48:12, Edit by Mbb.
  Fixed NO-TEXT-PAST-BOTTOM-P to work.  It previously choked when there
  were no newlines in the buffer.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/work/rompsite.lisp, 22-Jun-89 19:45:54, Edit by Mbb.
  Made END-RANDOM-TYPEOUT do a more-prompt, in case the user didn't give us
  a newline on his last line of output.  This was previously a bug.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/work/morecoms.lisp, 22-Jun-89 16:21:43, Edit by Mbb.
  Made "Capitalize Word" consistent with "Uppercase Word" and "Lowercase
  Word".  Someone failed to see how easy this was.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/work/diredcoms.lisp, 22-Jun-89 13:15:07, Edit by Mbb.
/usr1/mbb/lisp/work/rompsite.lisp, 22-Jun-89 13:18:00, Edit by Mbb.
  Moved DIRECTORYP from diredcoms.lisp to rompsite.lisp.  This is a
  generally useful function.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/searchcoms.lisp, 22-Jun-89 16:29:05, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed a bug in the termination test of the replacement loop.  It used to use
  a temporary mark to hold onto the end of the region which lost with multiple
  replacements on the last line with the end of the region at the end of the
  line.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bufed.lisp, 22-Jun-89 16:26:59, Edit by Chiles.
  Made DELETE-BUFED-BUFFERS a buffer local hook for the bufed buffer.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/work/filecoms.lisp, 22-Jun-89 10:43:51, Edit by Mbb.
  PATHNAME-TO-BUFFER-NAME now returns a string in the form of
  <file-namestring pathname> <directory-namestring> pathname.

  Deleted *name/type-separator-character*.


/usr1/mbb/lisp/work/echocoms.lisp, 21-Jun-89 17:05:36, Edit by Mbb.
  "Complete Keyword" now only merges with the directory of the default, as
  opposed to the whole thing.  This makes completion look more like the new
  confirmation.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/work/morecoms.lisp, 21-Jun-89 21:45:05, Edit by Mbb.
  Made "List Buffers" tabulate it's output.  It looks better that way.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/work/echo.lisp, 21-Jun-89 15:50:43, Edit by Mbb.
  Made FILE-VERIFICATION-FUNCTION allow merging of relative pathnames and
  nearly honest-to-goodness UNIX pathnames.  Eliminated all file-name and
  file-type merging, only merging with default directory.  However, if the user
  only inputs a directory spec, then he could only mean to pick up the
  file-namestring from the defaults.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/work/mh.lisp, 21-Jun-89 11:36:24, Edit by Mbb.
/usr1/mbb/lisp/work/rompsite.lisp, 21-Jun-89 11:41:52, Edit by Mbb.
  I moved MERGE-RELATIVE-PATHNAMES from mh.lisp to rompsite.lisp and
  exported it for its general usefulness.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/bindings.lisp, 21-Jun-89 13:44:07, Edit by Chiles.
  Added bindings for "Completion" mode.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 19-Jun-89 18:58:03, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified MH once again to supply nil and nil for the group and account
  information to RFS-AUTHENTICATE.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 19-Jun-89 16:28:48, Edit by Chiles.
  Changed binding of "Select Random Typeout Buffer".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/morecoms.lisp, 19-Jun-89 16:26:21, Edit by Chiles.
  "List Buffers" no longer shows random typeout buffers.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/work/pop-up-stream.lisp, 19-Jun-89 14:02:04, Edit by Mbb.
  Made line-buffered-moreing work.  A last minute fix before I it went into
  the last core broke this.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/work/pop-up-stream.lisp, 18-Jun-89 13:26:12, Edit by Mbb.
  Added :charpos feature to the RANDOM-TYPEOUT-MISC method because format
  uses it to implement tabbing.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/work/lispbuf.lisp, 18-Jun-89 12:19:52, Edit by Mbb.
  Made "Editor Describe Function Call" not supply a height to
  WITH-POP-UP-DISPLAY.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/work/spellcoms.lisp, 16-Jun-89 17:47:30, Edit by Mbb.
  Added a height specification to the WITH-POP-UP-DISPLAY call in
  GET-WORD-CORRECTION so the stream would be line-buffered, and thus visible.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/work/macros.lisp, 16-Jun-89 17:27:38, Edit by Mbb.
/usr1/mbb/lisp/work/pop-up-stream.lisp, 16-Jun-89 17:27:08, Edit by Mbb.
  Added FORCE-OUTPUT and FINISH-OUTPUT functionality to Random Typeout
  Streams.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/work/morecoms.lisp, 16-Jun-89 17:24:15, Edit by Mbb.
  Made "Point to here" issue the traditional "I'm afraid I can't let you do
  that Dave." message when the usere tries to make the special Random
  Typeout window current.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/diredcoms.lisp, 16-Jun-89 01:20:44, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed "Copy File" and "Rename File" to no longer think they run in dired
  buffers.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/bindings.lisp, 16-Jun-89 01:07:54, Edit by Chiles.
  Added binding for "Select Random Typeout Buffer".

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/bindings.lisp, 15-Jun-89 16:59:15, Edit by Chiles.
  Defined #\K to be a :keep logical character.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/echo.lisp, 15-Jun-89 16:43:16, Edit by Chiles.
  Added definition for "Keep" logical character.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 15-Jun-89 13:14:00, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified INCORPORATE-NEW-MAIL to better detect mistyped passwords with new MH
  error messages.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/lisp-lib.lisp, 12-Jun-89 14:55:16, Edit by Mbb.
  Made "Lisp Library Help" consistent with "Bufed" and other modes that now
  use the mode-description mechanism.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/window.lisp, 07-Jun-89 16:56:02, Edit by Mbb.
  Fixed a bug in WINDOW-FOR-HUNK that prevented anyone from making a window
  1 character high.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/pop-up-stream.lisp, 07-Jun-89 19:10:17, Edit by Mbb.
  This file replaces tty-stream.lisp and bit-stream.lisp and does essentially
  the same thing, but in a completely different way.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/display.lisp, 07-Jun-89 18:32:56, Edit by Mbb.
  Added two slots to the device structure: random-typeout-full-more and
  random-typeout-line-more.  These are called from the random typeout
  stream output methods to give users a neat scrolling effect on a bitmap, and
  on the tty they just clear the window and draw some more lines from the top.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/display.lisp, 07-Jun-89 18:32:56, Edit by Mbb.
  Made %PRINT-DEVICE-HUNK not choke when the hunk has no associated window.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/mh.lisp, 07-Jun-89 18:30:05, Edit by Mbb.
  Made the NEW-MAIL-BUF-DELETE-HOOK ignore buffer so the compiler doesn't
  warn that it was "bound but not referenced".

/usr/lisp/hemlock/bit-screen.lisp, 07-Jun-89 14:52:45, Edit by Mbb.
  Made BITMAP-RANDOM-TYPEOUT-SETUP create a psuedo-window to display a random
  typeout buffer.  Also made BITMAP-RANDOM-TYPEOUT-CLEANUP do the right
  thing.  Two functions were added to deal with the pseudo-window:
  MAKE-TTY-RANDOM-TYPEOUT-WINDOW and CHANGE-TTY-RANDOM-TYPEOUT-WINDOW.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/tty-screen.lisp, 07-Jun-89 14:26:48, Edit by Mbb.
  Made TTY-RANDOM-TYPEOUT-SETUP create a psuedo-window to display a random
  typeout-buffer.  Also made TTY-RANDOM-TYPEOUT-CLEANUP do the right thing.
  Two functions were added to deal with the psuedo-window :
  MAKE-BITMAP-RANDOM-TYPEOUT-WINDOW and CHANGE-BITMAP-RANDOM-TYPEOUT-WINDOW.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/screen.lisp, 07-Jun-89 15:07:50, Edit by Mbb.
  Modified PREPARE-FOR-RANDOM-TYPEOUT and RANDOM-TYPEOUT-CLEANUP to
  implement the new mechanism.  Also added the modeline field definitions
  for random typeout buffers.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/keytran.lisp, 05-Jun-89 12:53:12, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed a bugt in DEFINE-KEYSYM that alwyas ignores shifted characters.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 02-Jun-89 11:54:20, Edit by Chiles.
  Made FUN-DEFINED-FROM-PATHNAME not string-downcase the file.

  Changed occurences of WITH-RANDOM-TYPEOUT to WITH-POP-UP-DISPLAY.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bit-screen.lisp, 31-May-89 21:41:02, Edit by Chiles.
  The following functions were modified to accomodate using the extra space at
  the bottom of a window when there is no thumb bar:
     WRITE-N-EXPOSED-REGIONS
     WRITE-ONE-EXPOSED-REGION
     HUNK-PROCESS-INPUT
     MAYBE-PROMPT-USER-FOR-WINDOW
     BITMAP-RANDOM-TYPEOUT-SETUP   *** Merge with Blaine.
     DEFAULT-CREATE-WINDOW-HOOK
     DEFAULT-CREATE-INITIAL-WINDOWS-HOOK
     BITMAP-MAKE-WINDOW
     SET-HUNK-SIZE

/usr/lisp/hemlock/macros.lisp, 31-May-89 19:29:21, Edit by Mbb.
  Defined the macro WITH-POP-UP-DISPLAY that replaces WITH-RANDOM-TYPEOUT.
  The new machanism stuffs output into a real hemlock buffer and a pseudo
  window so users can get to it if they need to.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/rompsite.lisp, 31-May-89 15:35:11, Edit by Mbb.
  Rewrote WAIT-FOR-MORE and END-RANDOM-TYPEOUT, and added
  MAYBE-KEEP-RANDOM-TYPEOUT-WINDOW, that will finish output and keep the
  random typeout window if we're on a bitmap-device.

  Added random-typeout-xevents-mask constant.


/usr1/lisp/nhem/hunk-draw.lisp, 31-May-89 14:19:46, Edit by Chiles.
  Introduced hunk-thumb-bar-bottom-border, 10, and set hunk-bottom-border to 3.
  Modified hunk-draw-bottom-border accordingly.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bit-screen.lisp, 31-May-89 10:00:56, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified HUNK-PROCESS-INPUT to use extra bits below bottom line and above
  thumb bar as part of the bottom line.  This should eliminate problems with
  mouse scrolling and point-to-here functionality which otherwise would beep
  causing the user to move the mouse up a tiny bit.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispbuf.lisp, 26-May-89 14:21:11, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Select Eval Buffer" supply a buffer local delete hook that sets the
  special to nil, so Hemlock doesn't hold onto that memory.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/buffer.lisp, 26-May-89 14:18:50, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified MAKE-BUFFER to check the type of the :delete-hook arg.

/usr1/ch/lisp/complete/table.lisp, 17-Apr-89 18:41:11, Edit by Hoover.
  Exported STRING-TABLE-SEPARATOR.

  Fixed a bug in FIND-LONGEST-COMPLETION which made COMPLETE-STRING
  think some :COMPLETE completions were :UNIQUE.


/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 19-May-89 17:36:03, Edit by Chiles.
/usr1/lisp/nhem/dired.lisp, 19-May-89 17:34:35, Edit by Chiles.
  Replaced all %SES-NAMESTRING uses with NAMESTRING.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/unixcoms.lisp, 17-May-89 11:53:05, Edit by Chiles.
  Made SCRIBE-FILE move the buffer's point to the end of the buffer.  This
  still does not do everything you want:
     Queue multiple scribe requests.
     Leave a stream around all the time that gets cleaned up when the
        buffer is deleted, so it can have a disjoint mark from the buffer's
        point.  The stream is made whenever the buffer is made.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/diredcoms.lisp, 15-May-89 17:04:50, Edit by Chiles and MBB.
  Added "Dired Information" variable and structure instead of N buffer local
  variables.  Fixed a couple bugs.  Modified "Dired" to correctly handle
  file-namestring patterns ... prompts separately with argument.  Must prompt
  separately because cannot know user's intent and must canonicalize names for
  uniqueness when looking up dired buffers.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/xcoms.lisp, 12-May-89 11:35:24, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed bug in "Stack Window", paren mismatched.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/struct.lisp, 11-May-89 13:41:38, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified font-mark printing to use double quotes instead of ``''.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/interp.lisp, 11-May-89 13:40:05, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified command printing to use double quotes instead of ``''.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/htext2.lisp, 11-May-89 13:37:22, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified line, mark, region, and buffer print functions to use double quotes
  instead of Scribe ligatures, ``''.  Fixed a bug in mark printing that wrote
  its last string to *standard-output* instead of the given stream.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/mh.lisp, 05-May-89 17:01:39, Edit by DBM.
  Wrote "Message Help", "Headers Help", and "Draft Help".

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/bindings.lisp, 05-May-89 17:03:56, Edit by Chiles.
  Added bindings for "Message Help", "Headers Help", and "Draft Help".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/dired.lisp, 02-May-89 14:20:43, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed a bug in RENAME-FILE not handling a pattern and directory spec
  combination correctly.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 26-Apr-89 14:48:45, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified doc strings to work better with "Describe Mode".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/echo.lisp, 25-Apr-89 15:21:21, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified PROMPT-FOR-VAR to call CURRENT-VARIABLE-TABLES.  Modified
  PROMPT-FOR-FILE to look for the typein in the default directory before
  merging with the defaults and taking that potentially non-existent file.
  Re-order a bunch of stuff and cleaned up page titles.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 25-Apr-89 13:18:42, Edit by Chiles.
  Removed binding (bind-key "Do Nothing" #\super-leftup :mode "Bufed").

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 24-Apr-89 15:44:17, Edit by Chiles.
  Added "View" mode bindings similar to "Message" mode bindings.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/morecoms.lisp, 24-Apr-89 14:46:36, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified "Generic Pointer Up" and "Point to Here".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bufed.lisp, 24-Apr-89 14:41:51, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified "Bufed Goto and Quit".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/interp.lisp, 24-Apr-89 14:09:41, Edit by Chiles.

  command error.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/searchcoms.lisp, 20-Apr-89 18:35:53, Edit by Chiles.
  Rewrote QUERY-REPLACE-FUNCTION, modifying REPLACE-THAT-CASE and creating
  QUERY-REPLACE-LOOP, to clean things up.  Fixed bug in return values that
  broke "Group Query Replace".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/spellcoms.lisp, 19-Apr-89 14:40:36, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified CORRECT-BUFFER-WORD-END to return values other than nil when end and
  start were only one character apart.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/diredcoms.lisp, 18-Apr-89 14:23:38, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified ARRAY-ELEMENT-FROM-MARK to no longer move the mark argument
  since it can correctly count the number of lines in the region anyway.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/diredcoms.lisp, 18-Apr-89 11:11:21, Edit by Chiles.
  Rewrote "View Return" and "View Quit" since they didn't interact correctly.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/xcoms.lisp, 17-Apr-89 15:48:58, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed bug in "Stack Window".  It now signals an editor-error unless the
  device is a hi::bitmap-device.  This command probably should be deleted since
  it is somewhat silly and written only for one person.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/filecoms.lisp, 12-Apr-89 15:19:52, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Revert File" keep buffer's pathname when reverting to checkpoint file.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 12-Apr-89 14:48:52, Edit by Chiles.
  Added binding for "Select Scribe Warnings".

  Deleted bindings of "Goto Dired Buffer" and "Goto Dired Buffer Quitting".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/struct.lisp, 12-Apr-89 14:14:12, Edit by Chiles.
  Exported and provided a doc string for BUFFER-DELETE-HOOK.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/nhem/searchcoms.lisp, 11-Apr-89 13:44:13, Edit by Blaine.
  Made "Query Replace" and "Replace String" echo how many occurrences are
  replaced.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/nhem/searchcoms.lisp, 11-Apr-89 13:44:13, Edit by Blaine.
  Made the doc-strings for "List Matching Lines", "Delete Matcing Lines",
  "Delete Non-matching Lines", "Count Occurrences", "Replace String", and
  "Query Replace" indicate that they are sensitive to the active-region.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/nhem/scribe.lisp, 10-Apr-89 22:30:25, Edit by Blaine.
  Wrote the "Select Scribe Warnings", which goes to the buffer named "Scribe
  Warnings" if it exists.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/nhem/lisp-lib.lisp, 10-Apr-89 21:39:51, Edit by Blaine.
  Made "Describe Library Entry" and "Desribe Pointer Library Entry" put the
  user in view mode instead of normal editing mode.  Also added the command
  ARRAY-ELEMENT-FROM-POINTER-Y-POS which returns an array element whose index
  is determined by the y position, in lines, of the pointer.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/nhem/bufed.lisp, 10-Apr-89 21:29:20, Edit by Blaine.
  Fixed a few bugs in Bufed.  Made "Bufed Undelete" replace #\D with #\space.
  Made "Bufed Goto and Quit" use the pointer location instead of the
  current-point.  Also made bufed not move the current-point.

/usr1/mbb/lisp/nhem/diredcoms.lisp, 11-Apr-89 13:22:44, Edit by Blaine.
  Fixed bug in UPDATE-DIRED-BUFFER.  I was setting "Dired Buffer Files" inside
  of a dotimes when it should have been outside.

  Deleted commands "Goto Dired Buffer" and "Goto Dired Buffer Quitting" in lieu
  of "View REturn" and "View Quit".

  Wrote "Dired from Buffer Pathname".


/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 10-Apr-89 10:20:42, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified SUB-WRITE-MH-SEQUENCE to bind *print-base* to 10 when writing
  message ID's.

/usr1/ch/lisp/spell/spell-build.lisp, 08-Apr-89 16:55:52, Edit by Hoover.
  Increased max-entry-count-estimate to 15600 in order to build the new
  dictionary.  Updated filenames in comments and added a line specifying
  compilation dependencies.

  Picked up the latest ispell dictionary and merged in local favorites.
  This dictionary is available via anonymous ftp from celray.cs.yale.edu
  (128.36.0.25) and locally as /../m/usr/misc/.ispell/src/dict.191.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispmode.lisp, 07-Apr-89 16:25:51, Edit by Chiles.
  Added DEFINDENT for WITH-WRITABLE-BUFFER.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/diredcoms.lisp, 07-Apr-89 16:22:05, Edit by Chiles.
  Modifed INITIALIZE-DIRED-BUFFER and "Dired" to beep and blow off the dired
  when no entries satisfy the spec.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/echocoms.lisp, 07-Apr-89 10:49:09, Edit by Chiles.
  Added "ps" to "Ignore File Types".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 04-Apr-89 00:16:54, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote GET-STORABLE-MSG-BUF-NAME and used it inside SHOW-HEADERS-MESSAGE and
  SHOW-MESSAGE-OFFSET-MSG-BUF.

  Removed variable "Deliver Message Deleting Buffers".  I modified
  DELIVER-DRAFT-BUFFER-MESSAGE to ignore it.  This now also always deletes the
  draft buffer, regardless of whether this variable is re-installed.  Now the
  message buffer is always deleted unless it is kept.  "Delete Draft and
  Buffer" now also always deletes the message buffer unless it is kept.  IF the
  variable is re-installed this deletion will be guarded by it as well.


/usr1/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 03-Apr-89 12:21:51, Edit by Chiles.
  Changed binding of "Define Keyboard Macro Key" to C-x M-(.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 02-Apr-89 16:44:54, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed mail bindings that got switched up or something, "Next Message", "Next
  Undeleted Message", "Previous Message", "Previous Undeleted Message".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 01-Apr-89 16:38:10, Edit by Chiles.
  Bound "Bufed" to C-x C-M-b, and changed some c-'s to control-'s.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/morecoms.lisp, 31-Mar-89 18:24:30, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote "Generic Pointer Up" to replace "Push Mark/Point to Here" and added
  ADD-GENERIC-POINTER-UP-FUNCTION.  Modified "Point to Here" in accordance.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bufed.lisp, 31-Mar-89 18:34:40, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed "Bufed Goto and Quit".  Modified "Bufed" to move point to the beginning
  of the buffer.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 31-Mar-89 18:27:02, Edit by Chiles.
  Changed bindings of "Push Mark/Point to Here" to "Generic Pointer Up".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 31-Mar-89 13:40:46, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed a bug in SETUP-REMAIL-DRAFT-BUFFER recently introduced by tweaking
  cleanup hooks.  THis now makes a dummy "Draft Information" variable.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/macros.lisp, 29-Mar-89 22:19:57, Edit by Chiles.
  Changed error handler to take r and R for restarts instead of P.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/dired.lisp, 29-Mar-89 21:41:04, Edit by Chiles.
  Renamed MAKEDIR to MAKE-DIRECTORY.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/diredcoms.lisp, 29-Mar-89 17:04:51, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified some doc strings and rewrote "Dired Help" to use "Describe Mode".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bufed.lisp, 29-Mar-89 16:53:06, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed some documentation and rewrote "Bufed Help" to use "Describe Mode".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 29-Mar-89 16:45:08, Edit by Chiles.
  Added binding for "Bufed Help".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bufed.lisp, 29-Mar-89 16:36:53, Edit by Chiles.
  Added documentation to mode "Bufed".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/doccoms.lisp, 29-Mar-89 15:52:11, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote "Describe Mode" and hooked it into "Help".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/buffer.lisp, 29-Mar-89 11:24:19, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote MODE-DOCUMENTATION and exported it.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/filecoms.lisp, 28-Mar-89 17:24:47, Edit by Chiles.
  Removed "Rename File" and "Delete File".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/dired.lisp, 28-Mar-89 16:42:27, Edit by Chiles.
  Removed "[Yes]" from DELETE-FILE-2

/usr1/lisp/nhem/diredcoms.lisp, 28-Mar-89 16:03:16, Edit by Chiles.
  Moved "Delete File" here and made it consistent with the new "Copy File" and
  "Rename File" in that it calls out to the dired package.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/bindings.lisp, 28-Mar-89 11:32:03, Edit by DBM.
  Names for a couple of bindings were incorrect and have been
  fixed.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/diredcoms.lisp, 28-Mar-89 11:19:50, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified "View File" to name buffers better.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 27-Mar-89 13:01:14, Edit by Chiles.
  Forgot a copy and rename dired bindings.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 27-Mar-89 11:46:28, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed :delete-hook arg that was not a list.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 25-Mar-89 09:44:46, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote "Editor Server Name".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 25-Mar-89 09:37:57, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified INIT-EDITOR-SERVER to include process ID in editor server name for
  same user, same machine, multiple instance protection.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispbuf.lisp, 24-Mar-89 23:19:56, Edit by Chiles.
/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispbuf.lisp, 24-Mar-89 23:12:48, Edit by Chiles.
  "Reenter Interactive Input" must copy the region when it is active since
  moving the point changed the input region.  There also was a bug that it
  checked for the value of buffer-input-mark, but this has no global binding.
  It now checks for a binding instead of a non-nil value.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/spellcoms.lisp, 24-Mar-89 21:44:36, Edit by Chiles.
  Made CORRECT-BUFFER-SPELLING and SPELL-PREVIOUS-WORD always ignore trailing
  apostrophe s's on words.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 23-Mar-89 20:51:16, Edit by Chiles.
  Added Bufed bindings.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bufed.lisp, 23-Mar-89 20:52:48, Edit by Chiles.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bit-screen.lisp, 22-Mar-89 14:08:27, Edit by Chiles.
  Replaced idioms with BUFFER-START-MARK and BUFFER-END-MARK.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/buffer.lisp, 22-Mar-89 14:05:29, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote BUFFER-START-MARK and BUFFER-END-MARK.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lisp-lib.lisp, 21-Mar-89 14:32:14, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified all Lisp Library commands to signal an editor-error when not in a
  library buffer.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/morecoms.lisp, 21-Mar-89 14:22:02, Edit by Mbb.
  Made "Count Occurrences" use the active region when it exists, otherwise
  point to end of buffer.  "Count Lines Region" became "Count Lines", and
  "Count Words Region" became "Count Words".  These two use the active region
  now too.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/searchcoms.lisp, 21-Mar-89 14:19:17, Edit by Mbb.
  Made QUERY-REPLACE-FUNCTION use the active region if it exists, otherwise
  point to end of buffer.  Also, "List Matching Lines", "Delete Matching
  Lines", and "Delete Non-Matching Lines" handle the active region similarly.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/spellcoms.lisp, 20-Mar-89 15:17:19, Edit by Chiles.
  Made CORRECT-BUFFER-SPELLING and SPELL-PREVIOUS-WORD ignore apostrophes
  following words.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 17-Mar-89 11:16:13, Edit by Chiles.
  Replaced MODIFYING-MAIL-BUF with WITH-WRITABLE-BUFFER.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/buffer.lisp, 17-Mar-89 11:07:41, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote WITH-WRITABLE-BUFFER.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/window.lisp, 16-Mar-89 11:13:41, Edit by Chiles.
  Made MAKE-MODELINE-FIELD have a restart that clobbers the existing defintion
  of a modeline field name.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/display.lisp, 14-Mar-89 23:19:27, Edit by Chiles.
  Made REDISPLAY-WINDOWS-FROM-MARK invoke *things-to-do-once*.  Some commands
  were making buffers, using line buffered output streams
  (WITH-OUTPUT-TO-MARK), and when redisplaying from the mark.  This didn't
  allow the chance for the buffer's modeline info object's start fields to get
  initialized via UPDATE-MODELINE-FIELDS.

/usr1/ch/lisp/complete/table.lisp, 14-Mar-89 19:46:09, Edit by Hoover.
  Fixed a bogus declaration in COMPUTE-FIELD-POS.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/echo.lisp, 14-Mar-89 14:07:56, Edit by Chiles.

  ambiguous shit.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/echocoms.lisp, 14-Mar-89 13:22:31, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Complete Keyword" move the point in the echo area to the first
  ambiguous field for :keyword completion (when the prefix is ambiguous of
  course).

/usr1/lisp/nhem/filecoms.lisp, 14-Mar-89 11:04:49, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified PROCESS-FILE-OPTIONS to LOUD-MESSAGE and abort file options on
  parsing errors.  It still goes on to try to set a major mode.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/table.lisp, 13-Mar-89 13:17:32, Edit by Chiles.
  Eliminated optional argument to COMPLETE-STRING.  Entered code for signalling
  an error if the tables did not contain the same separator character, but
  commented it out.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 09-Mar-89 16:19:19, Edit by Chiles.
  Added more page titles.  Voided some character translations and made up for
  the few commands that needed to be duplicated.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/window.lisp, 07-Mar-89 16:37:18, Edit by Chiles.
  Added print function for modeline field info objects.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/edit-defs.lisp, 07-Mar-89 10:59:30, Edit by Chiles.
  Made GO-TO-DEFINITION use name-len instead of calculating it again.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 06-Mar-89 21:37:11, Edit by Chiles.
  Now make new mail buffer with delete-hook NEW-MAIL-BUF-DELETE-HOOK.  Delete
  old CLEANUP-NEW-MAIL-BUF-DELETION.

  Made CLEANUP-HEADERS-BUFFER, CLEANUP-MESSAGE-BUFFER, and CLEANUP-DRAFT-BUFFER
  no longer check for their appropriate information structure.  Made
  MAYBE-MAKE-MH-BUFFER set buffer local deletion hooks for these functions.


/usr1/lisp/nhem/buffer.lisp, 06-Mar-89 21:25:54, Edit by Chiles.
  MAKE-BUFFER now takes a :delete-hook argument, and DELETE-BUFFER now invokes
  these functions.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/struct.lisp, 06-Mar-89 21:19:05, Edit by Chiles.
  Made buffer structure have a local delete hooks list.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/highlight.lisp, 06-Mar-89 17:54:46, Edit by Chiles.
  Made HIGHLIGHT-ACTIVE-REGION no longer do anything on the tty.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/filecoms.lisp, 03-Mar-89 18:02:19, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed some recently lost functionality in "Create Buffer".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/dired.lisp, 01-Mar-89 11:07:46, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified ARRAY-ELEMENT-FROM-MARK to take an error message.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/dired.lisp, 27-Feb-89 15:03:49, Edit by Chiles.
  DELETE-FILE-AUX no longer outputs deleted file names on standard output.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/kbdmac.lisp, 23-Feb-89 10:36:37, Edit by Chiles.
  Changed "Define Keyboard Macro Key" message.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/rompsite.lisp, 07-Mar-89 17:33:05, Edit by DBM.

  format for the messages.

  Added load for hem:lisp-lib.fasl.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lisp-lib.lisp, 20-Feb-89 16:51:19, Edit by Chiles.
  This is a new file.

/usr1/ch/lisp/rompsite.lisp, 02-Feb-89 16:49:42, Edit by Christopher Hoover.
  Changed font path support to use EXT:CAREFULLY-ADD-FONT-PATHS.  Made
  Hemlock look first on the local machine and then in AFS for fonts.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/searchcoms.lisp, 31-Jan-89 11:00:10, Edit by Chiles.
  Installed "String Search Ignore Case" and removed "Default Search Kind".

  Changed underline font variable values and set up to really use X11 font
  paths.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 27-Jan-89 13:31:13, Edit by Chiles.
  Removed "Typescript" mode local binding of "Process Control invoke EXT:ABORT"
  to #\hyper-a.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/macros.lisp, 20-Jan-89 16:11:18, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed bug in LISP-ERROR-ERROR-HANDLER that allowed logical characters in
  COMMAND-CASE to throw us into the debugger with a recursive error.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/doccoms.lisp, 16-Jan-89 19:04:03, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed doc string for "Help" p.

  Fixed bug in PATHNAME-TO-BUFFER-NAME.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 05-Jan-89 17:21:54, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Describe Symbol" use MARK-SYMBOL

  Wrote MARK-SYMBOL and made "Editor Describe Symbol" use it.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/scribe.lisp, 05-Jan-89 15:55:23, Edit by Chiles.
  Made INSERT-SCRIBE-DIRECTIVE use the next word if the mark is immediately
  before it, instead of the previous word.  Cleaned up the code some and
  documented it (oh no!).

/usr1/lisp/nhem/spellcoms.lisp, 05-Jan-89 15:32:32, Edit by Chiles.
  Made SPELL-PREVIOUS-WORD return the next word when the mark is immediately
  before the next word, such that the cursor is displayed within that word.
  Renamed "Correct Word Spelling" to "Check Word Spelling" and "Check Word
  Spelling" to "Auto Check Word Spelling".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 03-Jan-89 11:37:50, Edit by Chiles.
  Made INVOKE-SCHEDULED-EVENTS bind *time-queue* to nil around invoking event
  function.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/hunk-draw.lisp, 02-Jan-89 15:53:58, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed problem with underline font leaving dots at the end of lines.  I was
  copying the pixmap onto the screen one pixel short of the appropriate length.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 23-Dec-88 15:13:07, Edit by Chiles.
  Rewrote "Compile Defun", "Evaluate Defun", and "Re-evaluate Defvar" to
  use DEFUN-REGION.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispbuf.lisp, 23-Dec-88 15:04:46, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote DEFUN-REGION and rewrote "Editor Compile Defun", "Editor Evaluate
  Defun", and "Editor Re-evaluate Defvar" to use it.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispmode.lisp, 22-Dec-88 23:43:33, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote MARK-TOP-LEVEL-FORM.  Rewrote "Mark Defun" and "End of Defun" to use
  it.  Added doc strings to START-DEFUN-P and INSIDE-DEFUN-P.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/keytran.lisp, 22-Dec-88 17:39:21, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed a bug in TRANSLATE-MOUSE-CHARACTER that would have tried to set the
  :lock bit for a character which our system doesn't support.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 21-Dec-88 14:26:09, Edit by Chiles.
  Replaced occurrences of FILL-REGION-COMMAND-AUX with
  FILL-REGION-BY-PARAGRAHPS.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/fill.lisp, 21-Dec-88 13:59:36, Edit by Chiles.
  Renamed FILL-REGION-COMMAND-AUX to FILL-REGION-BY-PARAGRAHPS.  Made some
  arguments optional.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/morecoms.lisp, 20-Dec-88 17:31:29, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified PAGE-DIRECTORY to clean it up and made it pull control-l's off the
  line strings if it occurred as the first characters.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/window.lisp, 19-Dec-88 13:52:23, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified WINDOW-CHANGED to update the modeline's dis-line length.

  Changed instances of WRITE-DA-FILE to WRITE-BUFFER-FILE.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/killcoms.lisp, 14-Dec-88 23:32:02, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed a bug in the KILL-REGION/KILL-CHARACTER interaction code -- needed to
  set the *delete-char-region* to nil when the previous command type was a
  region kill.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/echo.lisp, 14-Dec-88 22:40:43, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified PROMPT-FOR-BUFFER to disallow input of the empty string when no
  default is offered.  This now permits defaults to be specified with
  :default-string even when :default is nil, but when :must-exist is non-nil,
  :default-string must name an existing buffer.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/filecoms.lisp, 14-Dec-88 22:13:17, Edit by Chiles.
  Rewrote "Create Buffer".  It now offers a default of "Buffer n".

  Added doc strings for BUFFER-DEFAULT-PATHNAME and PATHNAME-TO-BUFFER-NAME.
  Changed what PATHNAME-TO-BUFFER-NAME does.  When there is a type but no name,
  it inserts *name/type-separator-character* before the type.

  Renamed WRITE-DA-FILE to WRITE-BUFFER-FILE, and READ-DA-FILE to
  READ-BUFFER-FILE.  Modified FIND-FILE-BUFFER and "Visit File".  Hope they're
  right.

  "Process File Options" no longer complains about a missing pathname.
  PROCESS-FILE-OPTIONS is willing to handle a buffer without an associated
  pathname.


/usr1/lisp/nhem/echo.lisp, 14-Dec-88 22:05:31, Edit by Chiles.
  PROMPT-FOR-BUFFER does not allow the empty string to be supplied anymore.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/srccom.lisp, 14-Dec-88 21:56:53, Edit by Chiles.
  Made the prompt for a destination buffer offer a sticky-default,
  "Source Compare Default Destination".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 14-Dec-88 13:19:01, Edit by Chiles.
  Updated modeline stuff to use MODELINE-FIELD.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/main.lisp, 13-Dec-88 13:52:20, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified MAKE-MODELINE-FIELD calls.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/morecoms.lisp, 13-Dec-88 13:50:07, Edit by Chiles.

  Renamed modeline-field-name to %name.  Defined setf'er.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/window.lisp, 13-Dec-88 13:40:45, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified modeline stuff to make names first class.  Renamed some modelien
  field objects.  Wrote MODELINE-FIELD, MODELINE-FIELD-NAME, and a setf'er.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bit-screen.lisp, 13-Dec-88 11:41:32, Edit by Chiles.
  Uncommented hook additions for WINDOW-BUFFER and BUFFER-NAME icon naming.

  Made PUSH-BUFFER-MARK signal a Lisp error.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 10-Dec-88 20:50:06, Edit by Chiles.
  Added doc strings for TEXT-CHARACTER and PRINT-PRETTY-CHARACTER.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/auto-save.lisp, 10-Dec-88 14:26:52, Edit by Chiles.
  Added some documentation and removed some bogus "interface" claims as per
  Rob's understanding of what "interface" means in a function's comments.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/macros.lisp, 08-Dec-88 13:49:04, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified doc string for EDITOR-ERROR.  It also now signals an error if the
  editor-error condition goes unhandled.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/interp.lisp, 08-Dec-88 13:37:02, Edit by Chiles.
  Established editor-error condition handler around command invocation.
  Editor-error's were being handled by the "internal:" error handler
  established in ED since these conditions are a subtype of error.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/filecoms.lisp, 06-Dec-88 14:29:26, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote DELETE-BUFFER-IF-POSSIBLE.  Added doc string for CHANGE-TO-BUFFER.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/xcoms.lisp, 30-Nov-88 17:36:43, Edit by Chiles.
  Here it is -- "Stack Window".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/filecoms.lisp, 30-Nov-88 17:36:19, Edit by Chiles.
  Moved "Stack Window".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/fill.lisp, 29-Nov-88 11:59:51, Edit by Chiles.
  Changed occurrences of %MARK-PARAGRAPH to MARK-PARAGRAPH.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/text.lisp, 29-Nov-88 11:58:01, Edit by Chiles.
  Changed %MARK-PARAGRAPH to MARK-PARAGRAPH.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/mh.lisp, 28-Nov-88 16:21:44, Edit by DBM.
  Modified CLEANUP-HEADERS-REFERENCE to set the message/draft-hdrs-mark to
  nil.  This is necessary if someone deletes the headers buffer before the
  message buffer.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/macros.lisp, 27-Nov-88 15:59:21, Edit by Chiles.
  Rewrote EDITOR-ERROR.  Created an editor-error condition with accesses
  EDITOR-ERROR-FORMAT-STRING and EDITOR-ERROR-FORMAT-ARGUMENTS.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/main.lisp, 26-Nov-88 14:56:25, Edit by Chiles.
  Deleted bogus export of *current-package*.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/command.lisp, 25-Nov-88 21:27:07, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified "Delete Next Character" and "Delete Previous Character" to call
  KILL-CHARACTERS.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/killcoms.lisp, 25-Nov-88 21:58:39, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote KILL-CHARACTERS and modified KILL-REGION (used to be %KILL-REGION).

/usr1/lisp/nhem/icom.lisp, 25-Nov-88 16:04:48, Edit by Chiles.
  Removed italicize comments file option.  Changed package spec to string.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bit-screen.lisp, 21-Nov-88 16:22:30, Edit by Chiles.
  DEFAULT-DELETE-WINDOW-HOOK-NEXT-MERGE now sets the next hunk trashed since we
  are somehow getting exposure events out of order with configure
  notifications.  We should be able to remove this when facilities fixes the
  new software it just released.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 18-Nov-88 13:54:01, Edit by Chiles.
  Made CREATE-SLAVE correctly get the name of the slave that just connected.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 18-Nov-88 13:52:21, Edit by Chiles.
  Made EDITOR_CONNECT-HANDLER set the name of the editor that just connected.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/hunk-draw.lisp, 17-Nov-88 09:08:04, Edit by Chiles.
  Made HUNK-REPLACE-LINE-ON-PIXMAP set gcontext :exposures nil.  Fixed the
  macro it uses to no longer require binding gcontext each time around the
  loop.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 15-Nov-88 21:25:50, Edit by Chiles.
  Added page of code for message buffer modeline fields.  Wrote
  MARK-TO-NOTE-REPLIED-MSG.  Created "Default Message Modeline Fields".
  Modified DELETE-MESSAGE and UNDELETE-MESSAGE.  Modified MAYBE-MAKE-MH-BUFFER.
  Modified "Deliver Message" and wrote DELIVER-DRAFT-BUFFER-MESSAGE.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/struct.lisp, 16-Nov-88 13:25:17, Edit by Chiles.
  Export MODELINE-FIELD-NAME instead ML-FIELD-NAME.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 16-Nov-88 13:32:48, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote EDITOR-DESCRIBE-FUNCTION.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispbuf.lisp, 16-Nov-88 13:39:41, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote FUNCTION-TO-DESCRIBE and modified "Editor Describe Function Call".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 16-Nov-88 13:50:14, Edit by Chiles.
  Made DESCRIBE-FUNCTION-CALL-AUX use EDITOR-DESCRIBE-FUNCTION and
  FUNCTION-TO-DESCRIBE.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 15-Nov-88 20:46:02, Edit by Chiles.
  Added message buffer modeline stuff.  Modified MAYBE-MAKE-MH-BUFFER for the
  creation of the message buffer.  Modified DELETE-MESSAGE

  Maybe D shouldn't be fixed width?

/usr1/lisp/nhem/window.lisp, 15-Nov-88 13:34:41, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified %SET-MODELINE-FIELD-WIDTH to not allow zero width fields.  Modified
  MAKE-MODELINE-FIELD to check constraints too.

  Fixed a bug in the :buffer-name modeline-field.


/usr1/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 15-Nov-88 12:30:32, Edit by Chiles.
  Replaced "nmmonitor" with "nm_active".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/display.lisp, 15-Nov-88 12:40:25, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed REDISPLAY-WINDOWS-FOR-MARK to force output and so on.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/buffer.lisp, 14-Nov-88 15:14:34, Edit by DBM.
  Made SETUP-INITIAL-BUFFER supply :modeline-fields nil.  This gets set
  when the editor fires up.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/tty-display.lisp, 10-Nov-88 16:23:04, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified occurrences of WINDOW-MODELINE-STRING to be WINDOW-MODELINE-BUFFER.
  Made dumb redisplay method set the window's dis-line flags to unaltered.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bit-display.lisp, 10-Nov-88 16:20:40, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified occurrences of WINDOW-MODELINE-STRING to be WINDOW-MODELINE-BUFFER.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/main.lisp, 10-Nov-88 16:07:07, Edit by Chiles.
  Added "Default Status Line Fields" along with DEFVAR's and PROCLAIM's for
  recursive edit and completion mode fields.

  Modified "Default Modeline Fields".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bit-screen.lisp, 10-Nov-88 13:11:49, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified BITMAP-MAKE-WINDOW to take modelinep.  Modified
  DEFAULT-CREATE-INITIAL-WINDOWS-ECHO to supply :modelinep t to MAKE-WINDOW.
  Modified SET-HUNK-SIZE to determine if the window displays modelines by
  checking WINDOW-MODELINE-BUFFER.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/screen.lisp, 10-Nov-88 13:02:34, Edit by Chiles.
  MAKE-WINDOW now takes a :modelinep argument.

  Added sets for echo and main BUFFER-MODELINE-FIELDS.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 09-Nov-88 11:43:45, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified a few MAKE-BUFFER calls.  The modeline fields for mail buffer should
  be redesigned when this stuff goes into the core.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 09-Nov-88 11:38:19, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified MAKE-BUFFER call.  Made "Set Buffer Package" do over buffer's
  windows calling UPDATE-MODELINE-FIELD on :package.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/echo.lisp, 09-Nov-88 11:31:34, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified MAKE-BUFFER call.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/tty-screen.lisp, 09-Nov-88 11:02:14, Edit by Chiles.
  Made main-lines be one less for status line.  Made echo :text-position be one
  less for status line.  Modified calls to SETUP-MODELINE-IMAGE.

  Made TTY-MAKE-WINDOW refer to modelinep argument and modified its
  SETUP-MODELINE-IMAGE call.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/struct.lisp, 08-Nov-88 21:52:14, Edit by Chiles.
  Added modeline-fields slot to buffer structure.

  Deleted window structure slots: main-pane, text-pane, modeline-pane,
  font-map, modeline-line, and modeline-width.  Added modeline-buffer and
  modeline-buffer-len slots.

  Added DEFSETF for BUFFER-MODELINE-FIELDS.

  Added modeline-field and modeline-field-info structures.


/usr1/lisp/nhem/buffer.lisp, 05-Nov-88 17:30:52, Edit by Chiles.
  Added page titles.

  Modified MAKE-BUFFER to initialize the %modeline-fields slot with a list of
  ml-field-info objects.  Now it takes keyword arguments.  Modified call in
  SETUP-INITIAL-BUFFER.

  Wrote BUFFER-MODELINE-FIELDS, %SET-BUFFER-MODELINE-FIELDS, and
  SUB-SET-BUFFER-MODELINE-FIELDS, BUFFER-MODELINE-FIELD-P.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bit-display.lisp, 27-Oct-88 21:09:46, Edit by Chiles.
  Removed calls to UPDATE-MODELINE-IMAGE.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/winimage.lisp, 27-Oct-88 20:51:21, Edit by Chiles.
  Deleted UPDATE-MODELINE-IMAGE.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/display.lisp, 30-Oct-88 19:47:04, Edit by Chiles.
  Stopped REDISPLAY-WINDOW and REDISPLAY-WINDOW-ALL from forcing output and
  calling the after methods.  This was causing INTERNAL-REDISPLAY to queue
  input events for the editor that weren't seen before going into SYSTEM:SERVER
  with a non-zero timeout.  This means SYSTEM:SERVER had to timeout, or another
  character had to be entered, before the unseen one was revealed.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/display.lisp, 27-Oct-88 15:10:58, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote INTERNAL-REDISPLAY and made REDISPLAY-LOOP optionally splice in calling
  the device's after-redisplay function.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 27-Oct-88 15:12:02, Edit by Chiles.
  Replaced calls to REDISPLAY with INTERNAL-REDISPLAY.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/morecoms.lisp, 26-Oct-88 15:50:43, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote "Goto Absolute Line".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/hunk-draw.lisp, 26-Oct-88 15:32:22, Edit by Chiles.
  Made HUNK-REPLACE-LINE dispatch on *hack-hunk-replace-line*.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/display.lisp, 26-Oct-88 15:15:47, Edit by Chiles.
  Added an after-redisplay slot to the basic display structure.  Made
  REDISPLAY-LOOP, REDISPLAY-WINDOWS-FROM-MARK, REDISPLAY-WINDOW, and
  REDISPLAY-WINDOW-ALL use this.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bit-screen.lisp, 26-Oct-88 15:03:05, Edit by Chiles.
  MAKE-DEFAULT-BITMAP-DEVICE now sets the :after-redisplay slot.
  REVERSE-VIDEO-HOOK-FUN now sets *hack-hunk-replace-line*.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/macros.lisp, 25-Oct-88 15:14:49, Edit by DBM.
  Fixed the restart case in lisp-error-error-handler.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/hunk-draw.lisp, 23-Oct-88 18:12:12, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed pixmap creation to be root depth instead of 1, so color stuff works.
  When inverting areas, now use boole-xor instead of boole-c2 and a foreground
  that is the xor of the foreground and background.  This makes color inversion
  work.  If A is the foreground, and B is the background, then A xor B is AxB.
  This value has the property that A xor AxB is B, and B xor AxB is A, thus
  inverting in color the region.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bit-screen.lisp, 23-Oct-88 16:26:43, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified BITMAP-MAKE-WINDOW to make the gcontext after we definitely have a
  window.  Made sure that where I destroy an xwindow, that I free the gcontext
  for that hunk.  Added a DEFVAR for *foreground-background-xor*, which is
  initialized in INIT-BITMAP-SCREEN-MANAGER.  This function also has corrected
  calls to GET-HEMLOCK-GREY-PIXMAP and GET-HEMLOCK-CURSOR.  Made
  REVERSE-VIDEO-HOOK-FUN deal with rthunk correctly for new strategy, and it
  calls GET-HEMLOCK-CURSOR now.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 23-Oct-88 14:17:19, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified FLASH-WINDOW-BORDER and FLASH-WINDOW to use an xor function and a
  pixel value that is the xor of foreground and background.  This allows
  inversion in a color window, that is for any pixel values including 1 and 0.
  Changed the cursor fetching code to no longer save the pixmaps hot spots.
  These are now generated each time you fetch a new Hemlock cursor, and this
  code now uses distinct graphics contexts for each pixmap (cursor and mask) to
  accomodate the color monitor.  This also seemed more correct in general.  The
  grey pixmap generation has been changed to not use XLIB:PUT-RAW-IMAGE since
  this required Hemlock to know every server/monitor's preferences for raw
  data.  Fixed pixmap creation to be the root depth instead of 1 when not
  making cursors.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/hunk-draw.lisp, 22-Oct-88 20:06:02, Edit by Chiles.
  Made HUNK-REPLACE-LINE-PIXMAP call XLIB:CREATE-PIXMAP with a depth of
  XLIB:SCREEN-ROOT-DEPTH instead of 1.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/buffer.lisp, 22-Oct-88 16:09:32, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified %SET-BUFFER-NAME to do the right thing if the name supplied was
  already in use but for the buffer being affected.  This allows the buffer to
  be renamed to the same name, but with different casing for display effect.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 21-Oct-88 18:40:11, Edit by Chiles.

  user used "Pick Headers".  Broke off part of it to form
  MAYBE-GET-NEW-MAIL-MSG-HDRS which is now also called in PICK-MESSAGE-HEADERS.
  Made "Incorporate and Read New Mail" set the unseen mail buffer's name when
  it already existed just in case someone used "Pick Headers".
  PICK-MESSAGE-HEADERS now checks for the new mail buffer, and when the pick
  expression is empty, it uses MAYBE-GET-NEW-MAIL-MSG-HDRS.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 13-Oct-88 11:31:13, Edit by Chiles.
  PROMPT-FOR-FOLDER was not giving must-exist to PROMPT-FOR-KEYWORD.  It was

  window.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/highlight.lisp, 26-Jul-88 17:26:32, Edit by Chiles.
  Did away with HIGHLIGHT-ACTIVE-REGION-P.  Replaced calls with
  REGION-ACTIVE-P.  Made MAYBE-HIGHLIGHT-OPEN-PARENS check the value of
  "Highlight Active Region" and REGION-ACTIVE-P instead of just the latter.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/killcoms.lisp, 26-Jul-88 17:21:36, Edit by Chiles.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 29-Jun-88 23:33:40, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote "Delete Message and Down Line".

  Made "Deliver Message" say "Delivering draft ...".

  Deleted GET-MESSAGE-HEADERS-SEQ.  Made SET-MESSAGE-HEADERS-IDS optionally
  return an MH sequence.  These were identical but for this difference.

  Made "Refile Message" and "Delete Message" maintain consistency.

  Made SHOW-MESSAGE-OFFSET-MARK return nil when it couldn't place the mark
  instead of signalling an error.  Wrote SHOW-MESSAGE-OFFSET-MSG-BUG, and
  renamed SHOW-MESSAGE-OFFSET-HEADERS to SHOW-MESSAGE-OFFSET-HDRS-BUF.  In a
  message buffer, we move back to the headers buffer and delete the message
  buffer.

  Added "Reply to Message Prefix Action" which controls prefix argument actions
  in "Reply to Message".
  
  Removed "Automatic Current Message" feature.
  Removed DEFHVAR just after "Headers Information".
  Removed when...show from:

/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 10-Jun-88 13:21:55, Edit by Chiles.

  replied-to folder and msg to nil.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispbuf.lisp, 09-Jun-88 20:17:30, Edit by Chiles.

/usr1/ch/lisp/unixcoms.lisp, 03-Jun-88 15:54:46, Edit by Christopher Hoover.
  Wrote the command "Unix Filter Region".

/usr1/ch/lisp/auto-save.lisp, 16-May-88 02:31:07, Edit by Christopher Hoover.

  the call sites.  Made "Message Headers", "Delete Message", "Undelete
  Message", and "Refile Message" supply particular prompt messages.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 19-May-88 12:14:27, Edit by Chiles.

  Spec".  This affected "Incorporate and Show New Mail" and "Expunge Message".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 15-May-88 15:40:24, Edit by Chiles.
  Made MH-PROFILE-COMPONENT take an optional error-on-open argument, so when
  this is used for sequence files, and the sequence file is not there or
  readable, then the command can continue ... assuming the sequence file
  operation is insignificant if the file cannot be opened.  Made
  MH-SEQUENCE-LIST use this argument.

  Made MARK-ONE-MESSAGE not write the file on :delete unless the message was
  really in the sequence before deletion.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispmode.lisp, 12-May-88 15:11:15, Edit by Chiles.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 11-May-88 14:03:29, Edit by Chiles.

  calls to STRIP-FOLDER-NAME for consistency.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 11-May-88 10:33:23, Edit by Chiles.

  Made DELETE-HEADERS-LINE-REFERENCES delete message buffers if they are
  not associated with a draft buffer.  If they are, then it cleans up the
  reference.

  Wrote "Reply to Message in Other Window" which splits the current window
  when replying to a message.  Made "Insert Message Buffer" try to delete a
  window if the draft is a split-window draft.  Made "Deliver Message"
  delete a window if there are a couple lieing around and the draft is a
  split-window draft.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/command.lisp, 10-May-88 11:19:21, Edit by Chiles.

  :access #o600 for read/write by owner only.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/spellcoms.lisp, 09-May-88 10:09:13, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Set Buffer Spelling Dictionary" hash on the namestring of the true name
  instead of what was given.  Made it also add the write hook instead of the
  "Dictionary" file option.  Stopped modifying "Write File Hook" buffer
  specifically, using ADD-HOOK now.  Made "Dictionary" file option LOUD-MESSAGE
  if it couldn't find the dictionary file, blowing the whole thing off.
  Changed "Message Buffer Insertion Prefix" to four spaces.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 09-May-88 09:34:43, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed a bug in SETUP-HEADERS-MESSAGE-DRAFT that associated the draft with the
  headers buffer which caused CLEANUP-DRAFT-BUFFER to try to delete a nil
  headers mark into the headers buffer.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 06-May-88 10:06:23, Edit by Chiles.
  Renamed SETUP-MSG-BUF-REPLY-DRAFT to SETUP-MESSAGE-BUFFER-DRAFT, modifying it
  to take a message buffer, message info, and a type.  The type is one of
  :reply, :compose, or :forward.  It does the right thing.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/tty-display.lisp, 05-May-88 17:26:08, Edit by Chiles.
  Rewrote CM-OUTPUT-COORDINATE to not use TRUNCATE on floats or LOG.  Changed
  it from a macro to a function too.  Now it builds the characters in a buffer,
  using DEVICE-WRITE-STRING to send the chars out.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/mh.lisp, 03-May-88 14:41:30, Edit by Chiles.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 01-Apr-88 16:04:09, Edit by Chiles.
  Rewrote (that is, mostly blew away a lot of code) GET-EDITOR-TTY-INPUT.  Blew
  away TRANSLATE-CHAR definition.

  Blew away all console character translation variables.

  Cleaned out console specific code in SETUP-INPUT and RESET-INPUT.

  Blew away use of *editor-console-input*.

  Blew away CONSOLEP.


/usr1/lisp/nhem/morecoms.lisp, 30-Mar-88 14:19:12, Edit by Chiles.
  Removed unnecessary (null b) check in "List Buffers".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/undo.lisp, 25-Mar-88 14:33:23, Edit by Chiles.
  Massively documented this stuff.

/usr0/ram/group.lisp, 21-Mar-88 13:58:49, Edit by Ram.
  Changed Do-Active-Group to save and restore the Buffer-Point around the code
  that hacks on the buffer.  This means that group commands no longer trash the
  point (which usually left you at the beginning of the buffer).

/usr1/ch/lisp/echocoms.lisp, 21-Mar-88 13:33:57, Edit by Christopher Hoover.
  Frobbed "Ignore File Types" -- deleted unknowns and added a few common
  binary formats.

/usr1/ch/lisp/auto-save.lisp, 16-Mar-88 16:54:00, Edit by Christopher Hoover.
  Made the call to write-region in Auto Save supply NIL as the optional
  argument for keeping backup files so that the luser does not end up
  with .CKP.BAK files.

/usr1/ch/lisp/files.lisp, 16-Mar-88 15:59:18, Edit by Christopher Hoover.
  Made write-region take an optional argument which tells it whether or
  not to do ":if-exist :rename" or ":if-exist :rename-and-delete".
  If the argument is not supplied, it looks at the hvar "Keep Backup
  Files".

/usr1/ch/lisp/filecoms.lisp, 16-Mar-88 15:20:00, Edit by Christopher Hoover.
  Added the hvar "Keep Backup Files".  This variable controls whether
  write region deletes .BAK files.

/usr1/ch/lisp/filecoms.lisp, 14-Mar-88 22:14:47, Edit by Christopher Hoover.
  Removed "c" and "h" from the file type hook which invokes Pascal mode
  since Pascal mode is worse than Fundamental mode for editing C code.
  Someday, there will be a real electric C mode.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 15-Mar-88 21:00:11, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote RE-INIT-EDITOR-SERVER to be the port death handler instead of
  INIT-EDITOR-SERVER.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/morecoms.lisp, 15-Mar-88 16:25:44, Edit by Chiles.
  Installed Naeem's mods to "Delete Previous Character Expanding Tabs" that
  saves on the kill ring after some threshold.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/command.lisp, 15-Mar-88 16:24:09, Edit by Chiles.
  Installed Naeem's mods to "Delete Previous Character" and "Delete Next
  Character" that saves on the kill ring after some threshold.

/usr1/ch/lisp/echocoms.lisp, 14-Mar-88 21:50:47, Edit by Christopher Hoover
  Deleted the hvar "Help Show Options" since it is not used anywhere.
  Added a real doc string for the hvar "Beep on Ambiguity".

  Fixed Complete Keyword for files to use the new whizzy complete-file.
  Added the hvar "Ignore File Types" to control which file types to
  ignore.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/morecoms.lisp, 10-Mar-88 20:59:36, Edit by Chiles.
  Installed "Defhvar" command.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/filecoms.lisp, 10-Mar-88 15:48:57, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified PROCESS-FILE-OPTIONS to invoke the file type hook when no major mode
  had been seen, even though some mode option had been specified.  Modified the
  "Mode" file option handler to return whether it had seen a major mode.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bit-screen.lisp, 08-Mar-88 14:57:10, Edit by Chiles.
  Made REVERSE-VIDEO-HOOK-FUN make sure there is an X window for the random
  typeout stream before trying to set its background.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/fill.lisp, 06-Mar-88 21:28:51, Edit by Chiles.
  Made %FILLING-SET-NEXT-LINE not call INDENT-NEW-COMMENT-LINE-COMMAND when
  there is a fill prefix.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bit-display.lisp, 06-Mar-88 14:15:17, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed redisplay bug concerning excessive counting of lines to clear.
  Otherwise case now stops counting cleared lines and packages off one clear
  operations if we are currently counting.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/font.lisp, 06-Mar-88 12:46:24, Edit by Chiles.
  Made *default-font-family* have a default value so MAKE-WINDOW and things
  trying to look at it under tty redisplay don't choke.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/main.lisp, 02-Mar-88 22:03:26, Edit by Chiles.
  Changed EXPORT of after-initializations to AFTER-EDITOR-INITIALIZATIONS which
  is really what the macro is called.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/font.lisp, 02-Mar-88 19:53:10, Edit by Chiles.
  Rearranged some functions.  Added doc strings for exported stuff.  Deleted
  hardwired structures.  Moved two parameters to Rompsite.Lisp.  Added logical
  pages.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispbuf.lisp, 02-Mar-88 14:12:30, Edit by Chiles.
  Made SETUP-EVAL-MODE make a local binding of "Current Package" to nil.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 02-Mar-88 13:42:49, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified "Set Buffer Package" to set *package* when in the eval buffer.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bit-screen.lisp, 01-Mar-88 16:00:24, Edit by Chiles.
  Made HUNK-MOUSE-ENTERED invoke the "Enter Window Hook" and made
  HUNK-MOUSE-LEFT invoke the "Exit Window Hook".  Fixed REVERSE-VIDEO-HOOK-FUN
  to change the background pixmap for a window, so you don't get a flash of
  white before Hemlock paints black when the window is exposed.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/filecoms.lisp, 24-Feb-88 12:26:07, Edit by Chiles.
  Changed "Last Resort Pathname Defaults" and "Last Resort Pathname Defaults
  Function".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 01-Mar-88 15:29:32, Edit by Chiles.
  Made SITE-INIT define "Enter Window Hook" and "Exit Window Hook".  Wrote
  ENTER-WINDOW-AUTORAISE as example hook for losers into autoraising.

  Put in DEFHVAR in SITE-INIT for "Default Font".  Modified INIT-RAW-IO,
  SETUP-FONT-FAMILY, and OPEN-FONT in conjunction with supporting this new
  variable.

/usr1/chiles/work/temp-hem/rompsite.lisp, 22-Feb-88 21:07:14, Edit by Chiles.
  Changed GET-HEMLOCK-CURSOR to not use ".mask" as a pathname, but to use
  MAKE-PATHNAME :type "mask" ... instead.

/usr1/chiles/work/temp-hem/lispeval.lisp, 22-Feb-88 21:01:49, Edit by Chiles.
  Changed CLEANUP-COMPILE-NOTIFICATION to not use ".fasl" as a pathname, but to
  use MAKE-PATHNAME :type "fasl" ... instead.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/filecoms.lisp, 22-Feb-88 17:15:35, Edit by Chiles.
  Introduced "Last Resort Pathname Defaults" and "Last Resort Pathname Defaults
  Function" and modified BUFFER-DEFAULT-PATHNAME.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/spellcoms.lisp, 22-Feb-88 16:50:33, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Check Word Spelling" output digits with possible correct spellings.
  Made "Correct Last Misspelled Word" take 0-9 in the command loop as the
  numbered word to use as a correct spelling.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/morecoms.lisp, 22-Feb-88 13:13:54, Edit by Chiles.
  Frobbed control flow in "Goto Page" and made it drop a mark when searching
  page titles a first time.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/auto-save.lisp, 18-Feb-88 17:25:10, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Save" mode turn off automatically in "Typescript" and "Eval" modes.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/main.lisp, 18-Feb-88 17:11:12, Edit by Chiles.
  Put "Save" mode in "Default Modes".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/indent.lisp, 16-Feb-88 14:41:34, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed bug "Indent" being called with a zero argument.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/searchcoms.lisp, 16-Feb-88 14:14:32, Edit by Chiles.
  Made THE four searching commands only drop a mark if the region is not
  active.  Also, make i-search ^G invoke the abort-hook.  Made incremental
  searching commands set the last command type to nil since each letter typed
  does not go through the command loop, and ephemerally active regions were
  staying highlighted throughout the search.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispmode.lisp, 14-Feb-88 20:34:03, Edit by Chiles.
  Added DEFINDENT's for some CLOS stuff.  Added one for "frob" for Rob and me.
  Added a few for system calls.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 11-Feb-88 13:58:31, Edit by Chiles.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispbuf.lisp, 10-Feb-88 20:11:14, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "List Compile Group" use OLDER-OR-NON-EXISTENT-FASL-P.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/highlight.lisp, 10-Feb-88 19:52:50, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified HIGHLIGHT-ACTIVE-REGION to not do anything when the window is the
  echo area window.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/killcoms.lisp, 10-Feb-88 15:55:19, Edit by Chiles.
  Augmented the active region flag with an active region buffer variable to
  circumvent echo area interactions.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/main.lisp, 10-Feb-88 15:46:29, Edit by Chiles.
  Made SAVE-ALL-BUFFERS optionally list unmodified buffers.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/highlight.lisp, 08-Feb-88 13:49:37, Edit by Chiles.
  Implemented highlighting active regions.  Renamed a bunch of open paren
  highlighting stuff, and frobbed it to interact with region highlighting.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/killcoms.lisp, 08-Feb-88 13:30:20, Edit by Chiles.
  Made CURRENT-REGION take another option to not deactivate the region.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 06-Feb-88 16:23:45, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed bug in PRETTY-PRINT-CHARACTER that was created by INSERT-CHARACTER
  checking the type of its arguments.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispmode.lisp, 06-Feb-88 16:17:20, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed Scan-Direction-Valid to return NIL when it hits the end of the buffer.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/killcoms.lisp, 06-Feb-88 10:11:35, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Exchange Point and Mark" no longer activate the region.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/fill.lisp, 06-Feb-88 09:53:14, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Fill Paragraph" and "Fill Region" use p as the column if supplied.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 04-Feb-88 15:33:11, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed the font stuff in initialization to not call TRUENAME on the font
  names.  This was wrong.  Fixed the font stuff to be aware of a font not
  opening, signalling an error if it is the default font and warning if it was
  the highlighting font.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/htext3.lisp, 04-Feb-88 16:02:41, Edit by Chiles.
  Made INSERT-CHARACTER check the type of its argument.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/searchcoms.lisp, 04-Feb-88 15:46:24, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed bug in i-search that allowed non-text characters to be searched for.
  Also in the C-q case, nil was trying to be inserted into a buffer which
  crashed Lisp.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/command.lisp, 04-Feb-88 14:21:10, Edit by Chiles.
  Provided error message for TEXT-CHARACTER nil result in "Self Insert" and
  "Quoted Insert"

/usr1/lisp/nhem/overwrite.lisp, 04-Feb-88 14:17:32, Edit by Chiles.
  Protected use of TEXT-CHARACTER, testing for nil result.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 03-Feb-88 11:57:33, Edit by Chiles.
/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispbuf.lisp, 03-Feb-88 11:57:33, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified "Compile Buffer File", "Editor Compile Buffer File", "Compile
  Group", and "Editor Compile Group".  Deleted MAYBE-COMPILE-FILE and
  MAYBE-COMPILE-EDITOR-FILE.  Wrote OLDER-OR-NON-EXISTENT-FASL-P.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/icom.lisp, 01-Feb-88 16:21:37, Edit by Chiles.
  Merged Scott's hack to the comment hack to keep highlighted parens clean.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/obit-screen.lisp, 01-Feb-88 16:08:35, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified OBITMAP-MAKE-WINDOW and OBITMAP-DELETE-WINDOW to invalidate the
  currently selected hunk.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/tty-screen.lisp, 01-Feb-88 15:56:53, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified TTY-MAKE-WINDOW and TTY-DELETE-WINDOW to invalidate the currently
  selected hunk.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/spellcoms.lisp, 01-Feb-88 08:28:09, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed MAYBE-READ-DEFAULT-USER-SPELLING-DICTIONARY.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 28-Jan-88 20:46:09, Edit by Chiles.
  Deleted binding for "Compile Buffer File" in "Editor" mode.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/interp.lisp, 28-Jan-88 11:18:47, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed problem with clearing prefix characters from the echo area when a bad
  sequence is typed.

/usr0/ram/lispmode.lisp, 27-Jan-88 17:21:48, Edit by Ram.
  Wrote Find-Ignore-Region and used it to implement Valid-Spot and the new
  Scan-Direction-Valid macro, which efficiently scans for a valid character
  having the specified properties of its attribute.  Used Scan-Direction-Valid
  to substantially rewrite %Form-Offset.  It now correctly handles character
  literals (and as a side-effect, symbols with slashed characters).  Also
  changed form offset to skip over prefix characters when moving backward over
  a list.  Users will probably notice this, and hopefully like it.

/usr0/ram/highlight.lisp, 27-Jan-88 17:15:35, Edit by Ram.
  Changed Form-Offset to List-Offset in Maybe-Highlight-Open-Parens.  Now that
  backward form offset on lists include prefix characters, Form-Offset is no
  longer correct.  Directly doing List-Offset is slightly more efficient
  anyway.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/highlight.lisp, 27-Jan-88 15:29:50, Edit by Chiles.
  Turned "Highlight Open Parens" off by default.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispmode.lisp, 27-Jan-88 15:32:12, Edit by Chiles.
  Turned "Paren Pause Period" and "Highlight Open Parens" on in "Lisp" mode.
  Set "Paren Pause Period" to 0.5 by default.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/tty-screen.lisp, 27-Jan-88 15:32:57, Edit by Chiles.
  Made INIT-TTY-SCREEN-MANAGER make "Paren Pause Period" and "Highlight Open
  Parens" be off in "Lisp" mode for tty's since we don't have highlighting
  fonts for tty's.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/highlight.lisp, 25-Jan-88 16:19:49, Edit by DBM.
  Chanded default for "Highlight Open Parens" to T.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/newer/rompsite.lisp, 25-Jan-88 11:30:43, Edit by Chiles.
  Made SLEEP-FOR-TIME deal with noting a read wait (dropping and lifting the
  cursor).

/usr1/lisp/nhem/main.lisp, 25-Jan-88 11:11:10, Edit by Chiles.
  Entered DEFHVAR for "Key Echo Delay".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/newer/interp.lisp, 25-Jan-88 11:06:01, Edit by Chiles.
  Frobbed %COMMAND-LOOP to try to echo keys after some typing delay.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/newer/lispeval.lisp, 24-Jan-88 19:43:50, Edit by Chiles.
  Made DELETE-SERVER look for all bindings of "Current Eval Server", setting
  them to nil if they referenced the argument info object.  Also made it delete
  the "Server Information" variable in the slave buffer if there was one.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/newer/rompsite.lisp, 24-Jan-88 19:10:52, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified EDITOR_CONNECT-HANDLER to define "Server Information" in the slave
  buffer.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/newer/command.lisp, 24-Jan-88 15:33:09, Edit by Chiles.
  Installed Shareef's "Refresh Screen" that knows about arguments.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/newer/lispmode.lisp, 24-Jan-88 15:27:06, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed bug in "Lisp Insert )" to make it echo the closing paren if it is not
  DISPLAYED-P regardless of "Paren Pause Period".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/highlight.lisp, 23-Jan-88 15:43:59, Edit by Chiles.
  New file.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/scribe.lisp, 23-Jan-88 15:42:11, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified SCRIBE-INSERT-PAREN to know about "Paren Pause Period" possibly
  being nil.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispmode.lisp, 23-Jan-88 15:40:57, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified "Lisp Insert )" to know about "Paren Pause Period" possibly being
  nil.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/morecoms.lisp, 23-Jan-88 15:36:22, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed "Mark Page" when point is at buffer-end.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/srccom.lisp, 23-Jan-88 15:26:40, Edit by Chiles.
  Put "Buffer Changes" from my init file into the core.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/filecoms.lisp, 23-Jan-88 15:21:36, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified "Revert File" to be more aware of whether it was backing up to the
  checkpoint file or the saved file.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/display.lisp, 23-Jan-88 14:01:50, Edit by Chiles.
  Changed REDISPLAY-LOOP and REDISPLAY-WINDOWS-FROM-MARK to do the current
  window first if it is going to get done, so the redisplay-hook effects could
  be seen in other windows into the same buffer.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/edit-defs.lisp, 23-Jan-88 14:47:28, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified DEFINITION-EDITING-INFO to correspond to the new
  FUN-DEFINED-FROM-PATHNAME ability to deal with encapsulations.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 23-Jan-88 14:36:33, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified FUN-DEFINED-FROM-PATHNAME, now deals with encapsulations.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/indent.lisp, 23-Jan-88 13:42:43, Edit by Chiles.
  Added Shareef's "Center Line" command.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/files.lisp, 23-Jan-88 12:42:10, Edit by Chiles.
  Made WRITE-FILE supply :if-exists :rename-and-delete.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 23-Jan-88 12:28:13, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Compile File" signal an error when buffer has no associated pathname.

/usr1/ch/lisp/filecoms.lisp, 22-Jan-88 11:48:49, Edit by Christopher Hoover
  Fixed write-region to call (current-region) before prompting for filename.
  This makes it work better with active regions.

/usr1/chiles/work/modeline/window.lisp, 19-Jan-88 09:58:24, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified DEFAULT-MODELINE-FUNCTION-FUNCTION and wrote
  UPDATE-BUFFER-MODELINES, which is exported.

/usr1/chiles/work/modeline/main.lisp, 19-Jan-88 10:10:27, Edit by Chiles.
  Changed the value of "Default Modeline String".

/usr1/chiles/work/modeline/lispmode.lisp, 19-Jan-88 10:05:31, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote SETUP-LISP-MODE to make a "Current Package" if there wasn't one already.

/usr1/chiles/work/modeline/lispeval.lisp, 19-Jan-88 09:49:29, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Set Buffer Package" use PROMPT-FOR-EXPRESSION, using STRING on the
  result.  It also now calls UPDATE-BUFFER-MODELINES.  When in a slave's
  interactive buffer's, do NOT set "Current Package", but change *package* in
  the slave.  Modified sites of (value current-package) to supply "" instead of
  the editor's *package*.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispbuf.lisp, 18-Jan-88 12:50:34, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified "package" file option to do a STRING of a READ-FROM-STRING.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/ts.lisp, 17-Jan-88 20:53:13, Edit by Chiles.
  Made MAKE-TYPESCRIPT use "Interactive History Length" when setting up
  "Interactive History".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispbuf.lisp, 17-Jan-88 20:51:25, Edit by Chiles.
  Moved some stuff around.  Created "Interactive History Length" used to setup
  "Interactive History" when "Eval" mode is turned on.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/spellcoms.lisp, 16-Jan-88 16:58:31, Edit by Chiles.
  Introduced "Default User Spelling Dictionary".  When set, this is loaded upon
  entering "Spell" mode and when "Set Buffer Spelling Dictionary" (or
  "dictionary" file option) runs.  Also, "Save Incremental Spelling Insertions"
  doesn't prompt for a file if this is set.

  Made SAVE-DICTIONARY-ON-WRITE make sure 'spell-information is bound in the
  buffer.

/usr1/ch/lisp/auto-save.lisp, 12-Jan-88 16:28:56, Edit by Christopher Hoover
  Wrapped a condition-case around the write-file in Auto Save.  This will cause
  Auto Save to graceful handle write failures.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/spellcoms.lisp, 06-Jan-88 22:14:14, Edit by Chiles.
  Made incremental insertions dictionary specific with a global default for
  upward compatability.
    Commands with new names:
      "Append to Spelling Dictionary" --> "Save Incremental Spelling Insertions"
      "Augment Spelling Dictionary" --> "Read Spelling Dictionary"
    New commands:
      "Set Buffer Spelling Dictionary"
      "Remove Word from Spelling Dictionary"
      "List Incremental Spelling Insertions"
  AND there is a "dictionary" file option that read a dictionary if necessary,
  makes it the buffer's dictionary, and causes the incremental insertions for
  this dictionary to be written when the buffer is.

  Added "Spelling Un-Correct Prompt for Insert" that makes "Undo Last Spelling
  Correction" prompt before inserting word into dictionary.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/doccoms.lisp, 22-Dec-87 15:42:26, Edit by Chiles.
  Changed #\S help to #\V, "Describe and show Variable".  Rewrote some code to
  do this and added the command "Describe and show Variable".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/spell-augment.lisp, 17-Dec-87 21:05:37, Edit by Chiles.
  Added SPELL-ROOT-FLAGS, which returns a list of the letter flags a root entry
  has, and SPELL-REMOVE-ENTRY, which removes an entry by clearing a flag if
  appropriate or setting the dictionary element to -1.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/spell-correct.lisp, 17-Dec-87 20:34:09, Edit by Chiles.
  Made TRY-WORD-ENDINGS return the flag mask when a flag was used instead of
  just t.  Modified lookup hashing to know about deleted elements.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/echo.lisp, 16-Dec-87 21:25:58, Edit by Chiles.
  MAYBE-WAIT should really do a SLEEP instead of EDITOR-SLEEP to make sure
  nothing happens while the user is trying to see the message.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/active/text.lisp, 14-Dec-87 01:25:42, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Mark Paragraph" and "Mark Sentence" use PUSH-BUFFER-MARK, so it will
  activate the region.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/active/lispmode.lisp, 14-Dec-87 01:25:03, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Mark Defun" and "Mark Form" use PUSH-BUFFER-MARK, so it will activate
  the region.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/active/morecoms.lisp, 13-Dec-87 20:45:48, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified "Insert Page Directory" to insert the listing at the curren point if
  invoked with an argument.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/active/lispeval.lisp, 12-Dec-87 13:15:04, Edit by Chiles.
  Defined "Slave Utility Name" and "Slave Arguments" and made CREATE-SLAVE use
  these to spawn Lisps.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/active/main.lisp, 11-Dec-87 07:24:44, Edit by Chiles.
  Defined and invoked "Reset Hook".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/active/xcommand.lisp, 11-Dec-87 05:37:26, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Region to Cut Buffer" use CURRENT-REGION, insisting it be active.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/active/lispbuf.lisp, 11-Dec-87 05:16:46, Edit by Chiles.
  Made commands use CURRENT-REGION, insisting it be active.  Changed the
  semantics of "Editor Compile Defun" "Editor Evaluate Defun".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/active/indent.lisp, 11-Dec-87 03:49:08, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Indent Region" and "Indent Rigidly" use CURRENT-REGION, insisting it be
  active.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/active/fill.lisp, 11-Dec-87 03:16:15, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Fill Region" use CURRENT-REGION, insisting it be active.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/active/filecoms.lisp, 11-Dec-87 03:12:25, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Write Region" use CURRENT-REGION, insisting it be active.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/active/abbrev.lisp, 11-Dec-87 03:05:12, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified commands to use CURRENT-REGION, not insisting it be active.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/active/morecoms.lisp, 11-Dec-87 02:40:31, Edit by Chiles.
  Changed calls to PUSH-BUFFER-MARK that shouldn't activate the region.  Made
  "Count Lines Region" and "Count Words Region" use CURRENT-REGION, not
  insisting it be active (for now).  "Insert Page Directory" sets the command
  type to :ephemerally-active, so "Kill Region" can kill the inserted text.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/active/lispeval.lisp, 11-Dec-87 01:52:20, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Edit Compiler Errors" not activate the region when it calls
  PUSH-BUFFER-MARK.  Made commands use CURRENT-REGION, insisting it be active.
  Changed the semantics of "Compile Defun" and "Evaluate Defun".  Fixed bug in
  FILE-COMPILE-TEMP-FILE.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/active/edit-defs.lisp, 11-Dec-87 01:32:31, Edit by Chiles.
  Made GO-TO-DEFINITION not activate the region when it calls
  PUSH-BUFFER-MARK.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/active/command.lisp, 11-Dec-87 01:25:22, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Beginning of Buffer" and "End of Buffer" not activate the region when
  they call PUSH-BUFFER-MARK.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/active/register.lisp, 11-Dec-87 01:01:22, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed bug in cleanup for deleted buffers -- should free register when its a
  mark since you cannot list it.  Made "Get Register" set LAST-COMMAND-TYPE to
  :ephemerally-active, so "Kill Region" can kill the inserted text.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/active/bindings.lisp, 10-Dec-87 23:41:40, Edit by Chiles.
  Added bindings for "Activate Region", "Pop and Goto Mark", and "Pop Mark".
  Bound "Verbose Directory" to ^X^D and destroyed translation for ^D, so I
  duplicated bindings for "Delete Next Character" and "Scribe Display".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/macros.lisp, 10-Dec-87 16:49:39, Edit by Chiles.
  Made ADD-HOOK	use PUSHNEW.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/register.lisp, 10-Dec-87 00:08:00, Edit by Chiles.
  New Register hacking code.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 09-Dec-87 13:55:22, Edit by Chiles.
  Made bindings for "Transpose Regions" and "Directory".
  Added default bindings for register stuff.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/morecoms.lisp, 09-Dec-87 13:36:55, Edit by Chiles.
  Added "Transpose Regions".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/doccoms.lisp, 09-Dec-87 13:20:28, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote "Show Variable".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/echo.lisp, 09-Dec-87 13:04:50, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified PROMPT-FOR-VARIABLE and wrote VARIABLE-VERIFICATION-FUNCTION to
  notice when a variable completion lost due to multiple entries of the same
  variable.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/spellcoms.lisp, 09-Dec-87 01:05:57, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Append to Spelling Dictionary" take an optional file argument.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/edit-defs.lisp, 08-Dec-87 18:18:44, Edit by Chiles.
  Merged with lost sources to get back the preference translation functionality
  where one directory can be mapped to an ordered list of translations.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 08-Dec-87 22:54:12, Edit by Chiles.
  Modifed eval-notification structure, EVAL-OPERATION_COMPLETE, REGION-EVAL,
  and FILE-COMPILE-TEMP-FILE.  Wrote PATHNAME-FOR-REMOTE-ACCESS and STRING-EVAL
  and the command "Load File".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispbuf.lisp, 08-Dec-87 19:48:43, Edit by Chiles.
  Renamed "Load File" to be "Editor Load File".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/main.lisp, 05-Dec-87 18:14:19, Edit by Chiles.
  Defined "Redisplay Hook".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/display.lisp, 05-Dec-87 15:37:53, Edit by Chiles.
  Put a redisplay hook into REDISPLAY-WINDOW-RECENTERING.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 04-Dec-87 21:10:14, Edit by Chiles.
  Made SITE-WRAPPER-MACRO bind *standard-input* to a stream that disallows
  reads.  This is to keep people from losing in "Eval" mode.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/filecoms.lisp, 04-Dec-87 15:00:50, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Visit File" set buffer-writable, so the buffer's region could be
  deleted when the buffer was read only.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/edit-defs.lisp, 04-Dec-87 14:54:21, Edit by Chiles.
  Created "Editor Definition Info" variable to control where "Edit
  Definition" and "Go to Definition" get their defined from information,
  the editor Lisp or the slave Lisp.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispbuf.lisp, 04-Dec-87 13:52:46, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Editor Definition Info" t in "Eval" mode.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 04-Dec-87 13:53:20, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Editor Definition Info" t in "Editor" mode.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/lispeval.lisp, 02-Dec-87 13:23:27, Edit by DBM.
  Mofified for new name server.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/rompsite.lisp, 02-Dec-87 13:22:10, Edit by DBM.
  Modified for new name server.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bit-screen.lisp, 29-Nov-87 22:55:03, Edit by Chiles.
  Made BITMAP-DELETE-WINDOW call REMOVE-XWINDOW-OBJECT on the X window
  instead of the Hemlock window.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/auto-save.lisp, 23-Nov-87 15:59:36, Edit by Chiles.
  Picked up Chris' latest version.  Tweaked a defvar into a defhvar.
  Changed its reference and made "Save" mode be turned off when nil or an
  empty pathname is returned.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 23-Nov-87 14:33:19, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed logic error in GET-CURRENT-SERVER.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 20-Nov-87 14:17:52, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote CALL-EVAL_FORM that makes sure the server isn't busy, binds and
  error handler, and binds a server death handler.  EVAL_FORM-IN-CLIENT and
  "Re-Evaluate Defvar" use this.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 20-Nov-87 13:22:23, Edit by Chiles.
  Made GET-HEMLOCK-CURSOR do a TRUENAME on the cursor bitmap file variable.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/searchcoms.lisp, 20-Nov-87 11:56:35, Edit by Chiles.
  "Delete Matching Lines" modified and new "Delete Non-Matching Lines" by
  Chris. 

/usr1/lisp/nhem/killcoms.lisp, 20-Nov-87 11:58:26, Edit by Chiles.
  "Delete Blank Lines" added by Chris.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 20-Nov-87 12:06:58, Edit by Chiles.
  Added binding for "Delete Blank Lines".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/morecoms.lisp, 20-Nov-87 12:10:21, Edit by Chiles.
  Added Chris' "Count Words Region".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/bit-screen.lisp, 19-Nov-87 00:02:04, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed problem with flushing random typeout with the mouse over the
  typeout window.  Apparently when X buries a window, you do not get an
  exit event, but Hemlock was getting an entered event and causing the
  cursor to get out of sync.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 18-Nov-87 22:39:54, Edit by Chiles.
  Rewrote CHECK-SERVER-INFO, SUB-CHECK-SERVER-INFO, and GET-CURRENT-SERVER.
  Added MAYBE-CREATE-SLAVE in the process.  Now when the current eval
  server dies, the next Lisp interaction command does not signal an error
  but tries to get a valid slave for the user.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 18-Nov-87 01:07:02, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote EDITOR-INPUT-METHOD-MACRO to replace the bodies of EDITOR-TTY-IN
  and EDITOR-WINDOW-IN.  Added to the macro a test for re-entering a
  Hemlock input method, signalling an error if this happens.  Added a
  binding of an error condition handler that exits Hemlock and goes into
  the debugger.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/bit-screen.lisp, 17-Nov-87 17:03:15, Edit by Chiles.
  Made enter and exit window event handlers call CURSOR-INVERT-CENTER when
  the cursor is dropped.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 17-Nov-87 15:40:42, Edit by Chiles.
  Made CREATE-SLAVE not call INIT-EDITOR-SERVER since we presumably catch
  nameserver crashes now.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispbuf.lisp, 15-Nov-87 20:30:20, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Compile File" do an update compilation.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 15-Nov-87 20:11:12, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Compile File" do an update compilation.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/main.lisp, 15-Nov-87 18:20:19, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed doc string of ED to escape some "'s.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/morecoms.lisp, 15-Nov-87 17:27:12, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Exit Recursive Edit" and "Abort Recursive Edit" call
  IN-RECURSIVE-EDIT, signalling an error when nil.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/buffer.lisp, 15-Nov-87 16:48:01, Edit by Chiles.
  Made EXIT-RECURSIVE-EDIT and ABORT-RECURSIVE-EDIT signal an error when
  not in a recursive edit.  Wrote IN-RECURSIVE-EDIT.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispbuf.lisp, 15-Nov-87 13:45:32, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Load File" supply (or load default buffer pathname default) for
  :default to PROMPT-FOR-FILE.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/, 15-Nov-87 13:24:00, Edit by Chiles.
  Renamed Integrity.Lisp to Hi-Integrity.Lisp.  Created Ed-Integrity.Lisp
  that currently includes tty redisplay testing code.  Modified Ctw.Lisp to
  conform with these two changes.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/tty-display.lisp, 15-Nov-87 12:35:09, Edit by Chiles.
  Generally added major gobs of documentation.
  Modified:
     COMPUTE-TTY-CHANGES
        Introduced cum-inserts.
        Changed computation of line deletions location.
        Changed where deletions are done for the modeline due to excessive
           insertion above it.
     DO-SEMI-DUMB-LINE-WRITES
        Commented out a somewhat bogus optimization that was causing
           TTY-SMART-WINDOW-REDISPLAY to lose when "Scroll Redraw Ration"
           kicked in.
     DELETE-SI-LINES
     INSERT-SI-LINES
        Changed variable names.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/filecoms.lisp, 14-Nov-87 13:38:42, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Write Region" use BUFFER-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 11-Nov-87 21:54:53, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified "Edit Compiler Errors" to not switch to errors buffer unless it
  has too.  This fixes spurious redisplay when there are no errors to edit.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/main.lisp, 10-Nov-87 19:19:13, Edit by Chiles.
  Removed DEFHVAR's for "Timer Hook" and "Timer Hook Interval".

/usr1/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 10-Nov-87 19:15:25, Edit by Chiles.
  Added page title "Time queue".  This is used in editor input stream in
  methods in conjunction with user interfaces SCHEDULE-EVENT and
  REMOVE-SCHEDULED-EVENT to all the user to have functions invoked
  periodically.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/main.lisp, 09-Nov-87 21:23:37, Edit by Chiles.
  Added AFTER-EDITOR-INITIALIZATIONS macro.  Made ED funcall stuff on
  *after-editor-initializations-funs* put there by the macro.

/usr1/lisp/nhem/filecoms.lisp, 06-Nov-87 00:59:21, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified WRITE-DA-FILE and READ-DA-FILE to invoke the "Write File Hook"
  and "Read File Hook" hooks.  eh!

/usr2/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 26-Oct-87 11:36:35, Edit by Chiles.
  Put back in feature of restoring previous buffer in "Edit Compiler
  Errors" that was lost somehow.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/filecoms.lisp, 25-Oct-87 17:13:04, Edit by Chiles.
  ROB: Split two subfunctions off of "Find File".  FIND-FILE-BUFFER does
  all the work, returning the buffer and a flag indicating whether it
  created a buffer.  Fixed some :prompt values.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/edit-defs.lisp, 25-Oct-87 16:42:00, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed bug in GET-DEFINITION-PATTERN for type :command.

/usr0/ram/group.lisp, 04-Oct-87 15:10:49, Edit by Ram.
  Changed Group-Read-File to use Find-File-Buffer instead of Find-File-Command,
  eliminating the need for gruesome hacks to tell whether a buffer was created.
  This also has the beneficial side-effect of making it easy for group commands
  to leave to buffer history intact.  Changed Do-Active-Group to restore the
  buffer that was current at the time the command was done.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/hunk-draw.lisp, 23-Oct-87 15:45:14, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote CURSOR-INVERT-CENTER to hollow out the center of the cursor.  THis
  is used when Hemlock is not the listener to corresspond with Xterm
  behaviour.  Modified DROP-CURSOR and LIFT-CURSOR to use this new fun too
  when Hemlock is not the listener, so we don't get little black squares or
  empty boxes when we should.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/filecoms.lisp, 23-Oct-87 15:36:25, Edit by Chiles.
  Inserted Chris Hoover's "Revert File" and "Mode" file option definitions.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/hunk-draw.lisp, 23-Oct-87 15:24:36, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed documentation for DRAW-HUNK-BOTTOM-BORDER and HUNK-REPLACE-MODELINE,
  stating dependencies on BITMAP-HUNK-MODELINE-POS not returning nil.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/bit-screen.lisp, 23-Oct-87 15:16:40, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed a usage of BITMAP-HUNK-MODELINE-POS that was assuming it was never
  nil.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/lispeval.lisp, 23-Oct-87 12:10:09, Edit by DBM.
  File-compile, Region-eval, and region-compile were passing a
  structure as a port to the servers.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 23-Oct-87 11:58:45, Edit by Chiles.
  Killed bindings for c-m-c and c-m-\c in "Echo Area".

/usr2/lisp/nhem/bit-screen.lisp, 22-Oct-87 15:43:08, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed BITMAP-MAKE-WINDOW to set the thumb-bar-p slot to (and
  modeline-string (value thumb-bar-meter)) instead of just the Hvar's
  value.  Windows without modelines were get a nil not number error.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/lispbuf.lisp, 16-Oct-87 14:04:38, Edit by Chiles.
  Made DESCRIBE-SYMBOL-AUX slightly better with respect to (quote <symbol>)
  (function <symbol>).

/usr2/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 15-Oct-87 22:22:13, Edit by Chiles.
  Made DESCRIBE-SYMBOL-AUX slightly better with respect to (quote <symbol>)
  (function <symbol>).

/usr2/lisp/nhem/edit-defs.lisp, 15-Oct-87 21:02:29, Edit by Chiles.
  Added a hack to catch command definitions when looking for the name of a
  function, and the last sever letters of the function name are "COMMAND".

/usr2/lisp/nhem/bit-screen.lisp, 15-Oct-87 16:33:54, Edit by Chiles.
  Made HUNK-EXPOSED-OR-CHANGED take a width and height argument since the X
  exposedwindow handler is supposed to now and eliminated the call to
  FULL-WINDOW-STATE.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/rompsite.lisp, 12-Oct-87 16:56:14, Edit by DBM.
  Added auto-save.fasl to list of files loaded.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/auto-save.lisp, 12-Oct-87 16:49:34, Edit by DBM.
  Added to the hemlock sources.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 06-Oct-87 00:18:25, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified "Edit Compiler Errors" to save a pointer to the previous buffer
  when moving to the background buffer, and to use this before EDITOR-ERROR
  calls to restore the user's position.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/edit-defs.lisp, 01-Oct-87 14:06:00, Edit by Chiles.
  Rewrote translation stuff and GO-TO-DEFINITION to handle a list of
  translations for a given match.  This allows me to first look on
  vancouver, then wb1, then lisp-rt1, then fred, etc. for sources depending
  on which machines are down.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/filecoms.lisp, 01-Oct-87 12:20:46, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified "Save All Files" to show the file it is going to write when
  prompting, and when the buffer name is not derived from the pathname, it
  shows both.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/bit-screen.lisp, 30-Sep-87 22:39:37, Edit by Chiles.
  Rewrote BITMAP-DELETE-WINDOW to not lose when a window is made and then
  deleted right away.  Created DELETING-WINDOW-DROP-EVENT that drops
  pending events for a window that is about to be deleted.  Also, made
  BITMAP-DELETE-WINDOW lift the cursor when the window being deleted
  displayed the cursor.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/ts.lisp, 30-Sep-87 21:57:18, Edit by Chiles.
  Made PROCESS_OPERATION_CONTROL-HANDLER test for *in-top-level-catcher*
  before throwing to top level.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/tty-display.lisp, 29-Sep-87 15:40:22, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified TTY-SMART-CLEAR-TO-EOW and TTY-DUMB-WINDOW-REDISPLAY to clear
  screen image lines properly ... had some off-by-one problems.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/lispbuf.lisp, 28-Sep-87 12:59:25, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Editor Compile Defun" and "Editor Compile Region" call
  COMPILE-FROM-STREAM with :defined-from-pathname supplied as the buffer's
  pathname. 

/usr2/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 28-Sep-87 11:21:07, Edit by Chiles.
  Made FUN-DEFINED-FROM-PATHNAME test for "/..", clipping it and the
  machine name if it is present in the defining file name.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 25-Sep-87 11:42:25, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified "Set Eval Buffer" to set the global eval server always.
  Modified "Set Compile Server" to set the global compile server always.
  Rewrote or added support routines SELECT-CURRENT-SERVER,
  SELECT-GLOBAL-SERVER, SELECT-CURRENT-COMPILE-SERVER,
  SELECT-GLOBAL-COMPILE-SERVER, GET-CURRENT-SERVER, CHECK-SERVER-INFO.
  Modified "Select Background" to try for the current compile server's
  background with a prefix argument.  Modified "Edit Compiler Errors" to
  look for a compile server before using the current eval server.  Added
  commands "Current Eval Server" and "Current Compile Server".  Introduced
  "Prompt for Current Server", so CHECK-SERVER-INFO does not prompt for
  creating a new slave but prompts for an already known server instead.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/morecoms.lisp, 24-Sep-87 23:12:42, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified "List Buffers" to show both buffer name and pathname when the
  are different and both exist.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/hunk-draw.lisp, 25-Sep-87 09:48:17, Edit by Chiles.
  Made HUNK-DRAW-BOTTOM-BORDER enhance the 80'th notch it draws.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/defsyn.lisp, 24-Sep-87 23:32:57, Edit by Chiles.
  Made #\formfeed no longer is a whitespace character.

  Did some "Argument Digit" binding.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/lispmode.lisp, 24-Sep-87 23:24:29, Edit by Chiles.
  "Minimum Lines Parsed" and "Maximum Lines Parsed" now default to 50 and
  500.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/searchcoms.lisp, 24-Sep-87 23:22:41, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Count Occurrences" use echo area for result instead of random
  typeout.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/filecoms.lisp, 24-Sep-87 22:16:48, Edit by Chiles.
  Made default for "Save All Files Confirm" be t.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 24-Sep-87 22:11:20, Edit by Chiles.
  Made binding for "Select Background", C-M-C.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/lispbuf.lisp, 24-Sep-87 22:02:32, Edit by Chiles.
  Changed "Lisp Describe" to "Editor Describe".

/usr2/lisp/nhem/doccoms.lisp, 24-Sep-87 21:56:40, Edit by Chiles.
  Replaced instance of LISP-DESCRIBE-COMMAND with EDITOR-DESCRIBE-COMMAND.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/lispbuf.lisp, 24-Sep-87 21:48:36, Edit by Chiles.
  Removed "Eval Mode" command.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 24-Sep-87 00:21:19, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed "Set Buffer Package" to not try to access nil when there isn't a
  current eval server.  Also, made it test for the server being valid
  before trying to use it.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 23-Sep-87 22:49:32, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified GET-CURRENT-SERVER and CREATE-SERVER to use
  MAYBE-GET-SLAVE-NAME.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 23-Sep-87 22:27:38, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified EDITOR_CONNECT-handler to handler name argument differently.
  Added definition of "Thumb Bar Meter" to SITE-INIT.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/bit-screen.lisp, 23-Sep-87 15:03:12, Edit by Chiles.
  Made HUNK-EXPOSED-REGION and HUNK-RESET call HUNK-DRAW-BOTTOM-BORDER.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/hunk-draw.lisp, 23-Sep-87 14:56:44, Edit by Chiles.
  Renamed HUNK-DRAW-TOP-BORDER to HUNK-DRAW-BOTTOM-BORDER and made it do it
  to the bottom.  Made hunk-bottom-border be 10 instead of 3.

  Likewise for EDITOR-TTY-IN.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/edit-defs.lisp, 20-Sep-87 23:57:08, Edit by Chiles.
  Rewrote GET-DEFINTION-FILE and wrote MAYBE-TRANSLATE-DEFINITION-FILE to
  have definition directory translation done in the editor instead of the
  client.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 15-Sep-87 16:44:28, Edit by Chiles.
  Made prefix key translation for #\control-^ to be :control.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 14-Sep-87 22:09:42, Edit by chiles.
  Modified "Set Buffer Package" to use new TL:SET_PACKAGE interface.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/htext4.lisp, 14-Sep-87 17:27:44, Edit by chiles.
  Modified DELETE-CHARACTERS to do nothing and return t when n = 0.
  Modified DELETE-REGION to do nothing when the region is empty.
  Modified DELETE-AND-SAVE-REGION to just return an empty region when its
  argument is empty.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/htext3.lisp, 14-Sep-87 17:12:52, Edit by chiles.
  Modified INSERT-STRING to not modify buffer when the string is empty.
  INSERT-CHARACTER always modifies the buffer.
  INSERT-REGION wins on empty regions because of INSERT-STRING.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/display.lisp, 14-Sep-87 17:14:52, Edit by chiles.
  Added some documentation to REDISPLAY-WINDOW-RECENTERING.  Modified
  MAYBE-UPDATE-WINDOW-IMAGE to return to or nil based on whether it updated
  the window image.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/cursor.lisp, 14-Sep-87 16:59:56, Edit by chiles.
  Modified MAYBE-RECENTER-WINDOW to return t or nil based on whether it
  recentered.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/filecoms.lisp, 13-Sep-87 18:37:15, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Log Entry Template" capitalize file author.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 13-Sep-87 17:59:15, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified server-info structure, removing the ll-buffer slot in favor of a
  slave-ts slot.  Modified CREATE-SLAVE to pass the -slave switch the name
  of the editor server in case two people are on the same machine (in which
  case they must use -edit differently), and instead of using EDITOR-SLEEP,
  it now uses SERVER (it was returning immediately on input with
  EDITOR-SLEEP).  Modified REGION-EVAL, REGION-COMPILE, and FILE-COMPILE to
  pass the slave-ts slot of the server-info structure of the notification,
  so terminal-io will happen in the interactive buffer for the server
  instead of the background buffer.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/main.lisp, 13-Sep-87 14:32:47, Edit by Chiles.
  Added DEFHVAR's for "Input Hook", "Timer Hook", and "Timer Hook
  Interval".  Added code in ED to handle Hemlock specific init files.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/ts.lisp, 13-Sep-87 15:34:09, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified READ-OR-HANG to message about input waits that occur while a
  buffer is not visible.  Introduced variable "Input Wait Alarm".

/usr2/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 13-Sep-87 14:41:27, Edit by Chiles.
  Made editor input stream methods deal with "Input Hook", "Timer Hook",
  and "Timer Hook Interval".  Modified EDITOR_CONNECT-HANDLER to correspond
  with new server-info structure.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/rompsite.lisp, 10-Sep-87 14:38:14, Edit by DBM.
  Now that Lisp no longer diddles the interrupt characters, the bare
  console has to be modified so that it doesn't send one of the standard
  control characters as part of the encoding for control characters.

/usr0/ram/htext1.lisp, 10-Sep-87 13:29:50, Edit by Ram
  Added a without-interrupts in Close-Line and some warnings about exclusion
  elsewhere. 

/usr2/lisp/nhem/lispbuf.lisp, 09-Sep-87 22:09:00, Edit by Chiles.
  Wrote "Select Eval Buffer" command.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 09-Sep-87 21:47:46, Edit by Chiles.
  Rewrote the local queuing of :unsent notifications.  This involved
  deleting all the old stuff and changing KILL-NOTIFICATION and
  MAYBE-QUEUE-OPERATION-REQUEST.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/filecoms.lisp, 09-Sep-87 18:17:34, Edit by Chiles.
  Changed "Log Entry Template".

/usr2/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 09-Sep-87 18:06:39, Edit by Chiles.
  Made MORE-READ-CHAR call REDISPLAY while looping on SERVER.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/tty-display-rt.lisp, 09-Sep-87 16:00:26, Edit by Chiles.
  Modified INIT-TTY-DEVICE and EXIT-TTY-DEVICE to not assume that
  system:*file-input-handlers* had an association for Unix stdin (0).

/usr2/lisp/nhem/lispbuf.lisp, 08-Sep-87 14:04:00, Edit by Chiles.
  Replaced appropriate occurrences of "top-level" and "top level" with
  "eval".

/usr2/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 07-Sep-87 20:56:39, Edit by Chiles.
  Replaced occurrences of "lisp listener" with "slave lisp" or "lisp
  interaction".  Renamed things to to with "anonymous client lisp" to
  "slave".

/usr2/lisp/nhem/tty-display-rt.lisp, 06-Sep-87 18:47:02, Edit by Chiles.
  Added some documentation to the exit method.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/filecoms.lisp, 03-Sep-87 16:12:28, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "Directory" list Unix dot files if the prefix is supplied and made
  the random typeout window have the right number of lines for each
  listing.  Made a "Verbose Directory" command like "Directory" but based
  on the new :verbose argument to PRINT-DIRECTORY.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 06-Sep-87 18:07:40, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed INIT-RAW-IO again to not push into system:*file-input-handlers*.
  Modified EDITOR_CONNECT-HANDLER to make "Slave Lisp <n>" buffer names
  instead of "Lisp Listener <n>" buffer names.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/tty-display.lisp, 06-Sep-87 16:54:18, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed TTY-SMART-CLEAR-TO-EOW boundary condition -- when clearing last
  line of window to eow, needed >= test instead of = test.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 05-Sep-87 15:52:11, Edit by Chiles.
  Deleted binding of "Exit Hemlock" to C-c since it is later used for
  "Process Control".  Changed binding of "Select Lisp Listener" to be a
  binding for "Select Slave Lisp".  Replaced occurrences of "top-level"
  with "eval".

/usr2/lisp/nhem/morecoms.lisp, 05-Sep-87 14:08:32, Edit by Chiles.
  Made "List Buffers" print pathnames with the FILE-NAMESTRING first
  followed by two spaces and the DIRECTORY-NAMESTRING.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/hunk-draw.lisp, 01-Sep-87 15:02:57, Edit by Chiles.
  Made CURSOR-INVERT do an X:XFLUSH.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 01-Sep-87 15:00:47, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed merge lossage from re-integration with sources.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 28-Aug-87 17:05:12, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed some bindings for "Editor" mode and put them on the right page.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 28-Aug-87 19:05:14, Edit by Chiles.
  Fixed bug in CREATE-ANONYMOUS-CLIENT-LISP and "Select Lisp Listener".
  Made "Set Eval Server" really define a buffer local variable when a
  prefix was supplied.

/usr1/ram/charmacs.lisp, 25-Aug-87 19:59:00, Edit by Ram
  Flushed Alt and Oops character names.  Added Escape as a name to shadow
  the initial Altmode name.  Added Enter and Action as alternate names for
  Return and Linefeed.

/usr1/ram/keytran.lisp, 25-Aug-87 19:44:24, Edit by Ram
  Changed delete to translate to delete rather than oops.  Made all random
  named keys translate to a super character when shifted.  Made keypad keys
  always translate to super characters.

/usr1/ram/bindings.lisp, 25-Aug-87 19:15:10, Edit by Ram
  Frobbed bindings to allow rational documentation.  Case-Insensitivize now
  translates to lowercase.  Use of Insert as an Escape standin had been
  flushed.  Insert is now used for X cut buffer operations.  Bindings to Oops
  have been flushed.  Interactive input kill/abort is now M-i/C-M-i.  Flushed
  redundant extra bindings of mouse commands to super-clicks (except for S-left
  being the same as middle).  Made S-Left and S-Right be illegal in the echo
  area.  Made illegal upclicks do nothing so that you don't get annoying double
  errors.  Made C-_ be a :Help character.  Flushed M-_ binding for Help and
  Help on Parse.  Made redundant bindings to backspace and return for C-h and
  C-m so that TTYs can win.  (Scribe mode is still wedged pending intallation
  of the new Scribe insertion command.)  Use Delete character name instead of
  Rubout.

/usr2/lisp/nnhem/searchcoms.lisp, 24-Aug-87 09:17:00, Edit by Chiles
  Added Chris Hoover's "List Matching Lines", "Delete Matching Lines", and
  "Count Occurrences".  Redid page breaks.

/usr2/lisp/nnhem/lispeval.lisp, 23-Aug-87 18:53:42, Edit by Chiles
  Rewrote "Select Lisp Listener" and wrote CREATE-ANONYMOUS-CLIENT-LISP to
  be used in the command and GET-CURRENT-SERVER.

/usr2/lisp/nnhem/tty-screen.lisp, 23-Aug-87 10:15:58, Edit by Chiles
  TTY-RANDOM-TYPEOUT-CLEANUP now calls REDISPLAY-WINDOW-ALL instead of
  funcall'ing DEVICE-DUMB-REDISPLAY directly.

/usr2/lisp/nnhem/font.lisp, 22-Aug-87 14:10:06, Edit by Chiles
  SETF methods for changing a window's font set the hunk's trashed slot to
  :font-change instead of t.

/usr2/lisp/nnhem/window.lisp, 21-Aug-87 19:59:19, Edit by Chiles
  Replaced numeric constants with symbolic ones.  WINDOW-CHANGED no longer
  redisplays, but it does update the window image (recentering if current
  window).

/usr2/lisp/nhem/pane.lisp, 19-Aug-87 22:34:12, Edit by Chiles
  Wrote OFROB-CURSOR to be the note-read-wait method for old bitmap
  displays.  Rewrote PANE-SHOW-CURSOR.  Titled pages.  Documented cursor
  stuff.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/obit-screen.lisp, 19-Aug-87 22:28:24, Edit by Chiles
  Added an initialization for the note-read-wait slot of the default old
  bitmap device to #'ofrob-cursor.  OBITMAP-RANDOM-TYPEOUT-CLEANUP now
  calls REDISPLAY-WINDOW-ALL instead of ODUMB-WINDOW-REDISPLAY.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/hunk-draw.lisp, 19-Aug-87 18:53:14, Edit by Chiles
  Rewrote HUNK-SHOW-CURSOR.  Added FROB-CURSOR.  Tweaked DROP-CURSOR and
  LIFT-CURSOR.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/bit-screen.lisp, 19-Aug-87 18:49:23, Edit by Chiles
  Initialized note-read-wait slot of default bitmap device to #'frob-cursor
  which is new in Hunk-Draw.Lisp.  Modified SET-WINDOW-HOOK-RAISE-FUN.  Put
  DEFHVAR in SITE-INIT.  Removed all references to BITMAP-HUNK-LOCK.
  Additionally modified HUNK-RESET, HUNK-EXPOSED-OR-CHANGED, and
  HUNK-CHANGED.  HUNK-EXPOSED-OR-CHANGED now calls REDISPLAY-WINDOW-ALL
  instead of DUMB-WINDOW-REDISPLAY.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/display.lisp, 19-Aug-87 18:46:16, Edit by Chiles
  Added device structure slot note-read-wait which is a function that
  somehow notes on the display that input is expected.  This will simply be
  dropping the cursor for now on the RT.  Rewrote REDISPLAY-LOOP to take a
  window variable to bind and two forms for general window redisplay and
  current window redisplay.  Added REDISPLAY-WINDOW, REDISPLAY-WINDOW-ALL,
  MAYBE-UPDATE-WINDOW-IMAGE, and REDISPLAY-WINDOW-RECENTERING.  Modified
  REDISPLAY-WINDOWS-FROM-MARK to use REDISPLAY-WINDOW-RECENTERING (which is
  also used by REDISPLAY).

/usr2/lisp/nhem/bit-display.lisp, 19-Aug-87 14:44:03, Edit by Chiles
  Reorganized pages some: put smart redisplay structure definitions on the
  smart window redisplay page, and retitle/titled other pages.  Did away
  with most macros, making them functions and moving their definitions
  below their uses.  Modified some call sites and argument passing of what
  were macros and now are functions.  Removed code from
  SMART-WINDOW-REDISPLAY and DUMB-WINDOW-REDISPLAY that is now encorporated
  into the REDISPLAY and REDISPLAY-ALL loops.  Removed references and sets
  to BITMAP-HUNK-LOCK.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/obit-display.lisp, 19-Aug-87 14:44:14, Edit by Chiles
  Moved definition of *current-font* from Bit-Display.Lisp to the only file
  using it, this one.  Removed recenterp argument from
  OSMART-WINDOW-REDISPLAY and ODUMB-WINDOW-REDISPLAY.  Also removed window
  image building code from these functions since it is now taken care of
  higher up in the redisplay calls.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/tty-display-rt.lisp, 19-Aug-87 12:26:13, Edit by Chiles
  Modified INIT-TTY-DEVICE and EXIT-TTY-DEVICE to destructively modify
  system:*file-input-handlers*.  Now the standard input file descriptor
  used for terminal streams is associated with an editor input handler
  instead of the editor having its own file descriptor.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 18-Aug-87 15:29:01, Edit by Chiles
  Modified INIT-RAW-IO to not open the tty device.  Now, it simply assumes
  Unix standard input.  Modified TTY-BEEP to not write to the editor's file
  descriptor which is Unix standard input but to write to 1 (Unix standard
  output).  Put DEFHVAR for "Set Window Autoraise" in SITE-INIT.  Modified
  SHOW-MARK to call REDISPLAY-WINDOW instead of calling the smart redisplay
  method out of the device.  Made editor connect handler store lisp
  listener buffer in server-info slot.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/tty-display.lisp, 18-Aug-87 15:13:41, Edit by Chiles
  Moved INIT-TTY-DEVICE and EXIT-TTY-DEVICE to Tty-Display-Rt.Lisp.
  Deleted code from TTY-SMART-WINDOW-REDISPLAY and
  TTY-SEMI-DUMB-WINDOW-REDISPLAY that was folded into the REDISPLAY and
  REDISPLAY-ALL loops.  Likewise for TTY-DUMB-WINDOW-REDISPLAY.  Also
  deleted recenterp arguments from all these functions.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 18-Aug-87 14:13:43, Edit by Chiles
  Made EDITOR-TTY-IN and EDITOR-WINDOW-IN drop and lift the cursor at most
  once, not each time SERVER is called.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/vars.lisp, 18-Aug-87 13:29:37, Edit by Chiles
  Fixed error form for GET-MODE-OBJECT to say the argument is not a defined
  mode instead of saying NIL isn't.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/buffer.lisp, 18-Aug-87 13:28:01, Edit by Chiles
  Fixed MODE-MAJOR-P to return MODE-OBJECT-MAJOR-P instead of
  MODE-OBJECT-NAME.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/morecoms.lisp, 11-Aug-87 12:03:46, Edit by Chiles
  JR fixed "List Buffers" to print the pathname of the buffer unless there
  was not one or the buffer names was not derived from it.  Otherwise,
  print the buffer name.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 30-Jul-87 15:26:08, Edit by Chiles
  Added binding for C-M-\L to "Illegal" in "Echo Area" mode.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/line.lisp, 29-Jul-87 15:28:41, Edit by Chiles
  Rob documented the line defstruct, eliminating the chars slot in favor of
  always having the %chars slot.  Added a macro for LINE-%CHARS instead of
  symbol-function and symbol-plist hackery.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/struct.lisp, 29-Jul-87 15:31:55, Edit by Chiles
  Fixed documentation on COMMANDP.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/echo.lisp, 28-Jul-87 16:26:44, Edit by Chiles
  Merged some code from the Perq to fix up current buffer and window when
  trying to confirm a non-existent parse.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/bit-screen.lisp, 26-Jul-87 20:13:05, Edit by Chiles
  Made SET-WINDOW-HOOK-RAISE-FUN look at the value of "Set Window Autoraise".

/usr2/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 26-Jul-87 19:59:31, Edit by Chiles
  Made EDITOR-SLEEP loop around SERVER using its timeout functionality
  instead of busy looping.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 26-Jul-87 20:04:08, Edit by Chiles
  Made loop waiting for anonymous client lisp use EDITOR-SLEEP which loops
  around SERVER.  Before, the client Lisp could never connect since SERVER
  was never being called.

  Wrote "Select Lisp Listener" command.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/tty-display.lisp, 26-Jul-87 18:56:41, Edit by Chiles
  Fixed display bug involving lines that are both new and changed (seen
  often in the echo area for some reason).

/usr2/lisp/nhem/filecoms.lisp, 25-Jul-87 19:37:16, Edit by Chiles
  Fixed "Select Previous Buffer" to not call "Circulate Buffer" since it
  doesn't exist.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/macros.lisp, 25-Jul-87 18:30:59, Edit by Chiles
  Made LISP-ERROR-ERROR-HANDLER have an E command that reports the
  condition it was called on in a pop-up window.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/lispeval.lisp, 25-Jul-87 19:28:23, Edit by Chiles
  Made FILE-COMPILE use a temporary output file for compiler output when
  its ouput-file argument is not t.  This temporary file is publicly
  writeable in case the eval server is running on another machine.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/edit-defs.lisp, 25-Jul-87 19:25:32, Edit by Chiles
  Made "Go to Definition" and "Edit Definition" use the client Lisp to
  determine where something is defined.  Had to restructure the code
  significantly, but it can be put back to non-eval-server functionality
  easily and cleanly.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 23-Jul-87 11:07:22, Edit by Chiles
  Added bindings for "Process Control", "Editor Evaluate Expression", and
  "Select Lisp Listener".

Rompsite.Lisp, while doing eval-server, Edit by Chiles
  Tty streams now loop over SERVER for input, so the eval-server stuff can
  be used on terminals.  There are a couple new functions for connection to
  editor servers.

Lispeval.Lisp, while doing eval-server, Edit by Chiles
  This is a new file replacing a lot of commands in Lispbuf.Lisp with
  similar commands that use the eval server interface.  New in this file
  from the Perq implementation is function description.

Ts.Lisp, while doing eval-server, Edit by Chiles
  This is a new file that implements the server side of the typescript
  protocol.

Morecoms.Lisp, while doing eval-server, Edit by Chiles
  Made "Do Nothing", typically bound to up mouse clicks, propagate the last
  command type (as if nothing happened).  This was needed to make
  super-rightup keep the command type of super-rightdown ("Insert Kill Buffer").

Keytran.Lisp, while doing eval-server, Edit by Chiles
  Made shift-mouseclicks send super-mouseclick.

Bindings.Lisp, while doing eval-server, Edit by Chiles
  Addeds lots of new bindings and changed a few with respect to the
  eval-server stuff going in.

Bit-Screen.Lisp, while doing eval-server, Edit by Chiles
  Fixed initial windows hook to keep echo area border visible on the screen
  by hacking in another -2 pixels.  This might be because X has by default
  moves windows down from the top, so the top borders will show.

/usr1/ram/lispmode.lisp, 01-Jul-87 12:04:59, Edit by Ram
  Fixed Quest-For-Balancing-Paren to use the net-open and net-close information
  correctly.  It's silly to go to the trouble of computing this information,
  and then (incorrectly) compute a paren balance by subtracting the two.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/streams.lisp, 19-Jun-87 18:02:55, Edit by Chiles
  Merged in some fixes from old Perq version.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/lispbuf.lisp, 19-Jun-87 17:54:25, Edit by Chiles
  Changed the following command names to be prefixed by "Editor ":
     "Editor Evaluate Defun"
     "Editor Re-evaluate Defvar"
     "Editor Evaluate Expression"
     "Editor Compile Defun"
     "Editor Compile Region"
     "Editor Evaluate Region"
     "Editor Evaluate Buffer"
     "Editor Compile File"
     "Editor Compile Group"
     "Editor Describe Function Call"
     "Editor Describe Symbol".
  Removed old reference to KILL-TOP-LEVEL-INPUT-COMMAND in "Top-Level Eval".

/usr2/lisp/nhem/killcoms.lisp, 19-Jun-87 17:39:34, Edit by Chiles
  Wrote BUFFER-MARK which is to CURRENT-MARK as BUFFER-POINT is to
  CURRENT-POINT.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/filecoms.lisp, 16-Jun-87 23:25:52, Edit by Chiles
  Removed the definition of the "Package" file option, placing a new
  version in Lispbuf.Lisp.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/srccom.lisp, 18-Jun-87 10:23:01, Edit by Chiles
  Made "Compare Buffers" and "Merge Buffers" only handle the current region
  in each buffer when the prefix argument is supplied.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/bindings.lisp, 16-Jun-87 14:09:20, Edit by Chiles
  Added bindings for super-<mouseclick> characters.  Added binding for
  "Exit Hemlock".  Added binding for "Circulate Buffer".

/usr2/lisp/nhem/morecoms.lisp, 15-Jun-87 22:18:26, Edit by Chiles
  Made "Do Nothing" set the last command type to its current value.
  Added "Insert Kill Buffer".

/usr2/lisp/nhem/echocoms.lisp, 15-Jun-87 13:47:15, Edit by Chiles
  Made "Help on Parse" check for *parse-help* being nil.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/bit-screen.lisp, 08-Jun-87 12:20:39, Edit by Chiles
  Modified DEFAULT-CREATE-INITIAL-WINDOWS-HOOK to added in a couple more
  border widths, so the echo area's bottom border is visible.

*************************

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/rompsite.lisp, 03-Jun-87 10:09:24, Edit by DBM.
  All references to the accint package have been changed to Mach.

/usr1/lisp/hemlock/obit-screen.lisp, 03-Jun-87 10:05:34, Edit by DBM.
  All references to the accint package have been changed to Mach.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/tty-display.lisp, 01-Jun-87 21:25:15, Edit by Chiles
  Modified TTY-SMART-WINDOW-REDISPLAY to punt insert/delete line
  optimizations in favor of redrawing every altered line when "Scroll
  Redraw Ratio" is exceeded.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/command.lisp, 01-Jun-87 21:12:21, Edit by Chiles
  "Scroll Redraw Ratio" is a new Hemlock variable that controls the
  abortion of insert/delete line optimization in terminal redisplay in
  favor of redrawing all altered lines.  This is used in Tty-Display.Lisp.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/tty-display.lisp, 27-May-87 14:38:50, Edit by Chiles
  Wrote TTY-SMART-CLEAR-TO-EOW to use the internal screen image instead of
  TTY-SEMI-DUMB-WINDOW-REDISPLAY and TTY-SMART-WINDOW-REDISPLAY using the
  clear-to-eow method that clears every line disregarding internal
  information.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/rompsite.lisp, 26-May-87 16:14:27, Edit by Chiles
  Modified EDITOR-TTY-IN to detect lowercase control g's.

/usr2/lisp/nhem/bit-screen.lisp, 25-May-87 17:40:30, Edit by Chiles
  Modified arguments to X window event handlers as per the changes in
  X.Lisp.

/usr1/ram/spellcoms.lisp, 22-May-87 04:02:19, Edit by Ram
  Fixed Fix-Word to bump the mark in the all uppercase case even when the word
  is already in the hashtable.

/usr1/ram/echo.lisp, 14-May-87 13:07:07, Edit by Ram
  Changed Message to use displayed-p on the buffer end to tell whether the echo
  area needs to be cleared rather than just counting the lines.  This works
  much better in the presence of wrapped lines.

/usr1/ram/cursor.lisp, 14-May-87 13:02:09, Edit by Ram
  Changed renamed Display-P to %Displayed-P, and wrote Displayed-P which does
  an update-window-iamge before calling %Displayed-P.

/usr2/lisp/xhem/xcommand.lisp, 12-May-87 16:00:16, Edit by Chiles
  This is a new file of X specific commands.  Currently it only contains
  "Insert Cut Buffer" and "Region to Cut Buffer".

/usr2/lisp/xhem/keyboard_codes.lisp, 12-May-87 15:55:42, Edit by Chiles
  Modified some translations to work better with the new key bindings.

/usr2/lisp/xhem/lispbuf.lisp, 12-May-87 14:43:15, Edit by Chiles
  Added "List Compile File" and "Re-evaluate Defvar".

/usr2/lisp/xhem/command.lisp, 12-May-87 14:07:11, Edit by Chiles
  Modified "Self Insert" and "Quoted Insert" to handler new TEXT-CHARACTER
  in Rompsite.Lisp.

/usr2/lisp/xhem/morecoms.lisp, 12-May-87 14:01:29, Edit by Chiles
  Made "List Buffers" on a prefix argument list only modified buffers.

/usr2/lisp/xhem/main.lisp, 12-May-87 12:55:51, Edit by Chiles
  Stopped ED from calling REDISPLAY-ALL when the editor has been entered
  already and moved this into the device init methods that require this.

/usr2/lisp/xhem/lispmode.lisp, 12-May-87 12:53:32, Edit by Chiles
  Blasted a couple bogus type declarations on some DEFSTRUCT slots.
  Inserted a few lines to LISP-INDENTATION from my init file.

/usr2/lisp/xhem/indent.lisp, 12-May-87 12:48:29, Edit by Chiles
  Replaced a couple SCAN-CHAR and REV-SCAN-CHAR uses with FIND-ATTRIBUTE
  and REVERSE-FIND-ATTRIBUTE, so compilation in a Lisp without Hemlock
  wouldn't lose.

/usr2/lisp/xhem/filecoms.lisp, 12-May-87 12:42:08, Edit by Chiles
  Renamed "New Window" to "Split Window", and made "New Window" prompt the
  user for a window.

/usr2/lisp/xhem/charmacs.lisp, 12-May-87 12:24:05, Edit by Chiles
  Modified character name a-list.  Rob Flushed addition of the command-bits
  feature and added the all-bit-names constant. 

/usr2/lisp/xhem/window.lisp, 12-May-87 11:47:35, Edit by Chiles
  This contains the stuff we still need from Owindow.Lisp and some new
  stuff brought over from the Perq.

/usr2/lisp/xhem/tty-screen.lisp, 12-May-87 11:43:55, Edit by Chiles
  Modified to fit the new device independent structure, adding beep and
  finish-output methods.  Creating and Deleting window methods now set
  *screen-image-trashed since not all devices need this.  Random typeout
  methods got an extra argument that we ignore.

/usr2/lisp/xhem/struct.lisp, 12-May-87 11:37:25, Edit by Chiles
  Modified window, dis-line, and font structures.  When the old bitmap
  stuff goes away, so will a few slots of windows.  Also, some old setf
  stuff for old font information will go away.

/usr2/lisp/xhem/screen.lisp, 12-May-87 11:34:06, Edit by Chiles
  Modified to be once-again device independent with respect to the addition
  of Hemlock running under X windows.  MAKE-WINDOW and DELETE-WINDOW no
  longer set *screen-image-trashed* since this isn't necessary for all
  devices.

/usr2/lisp/xhem/rompsite.lisp, 12-May-87 00:56:01, Edit by Chiles
  SITE-INIT is all new and defines some Hemlock variables for controlling
  some of the X activity.  INIT-RAW-IO is much bigger now for initializing
  stuff when we are running under X.  *editor-windowed-input* is set to t
  when we are running under X, and WINDOWED-MONITOR-P returns the value of
  this variable for use is other files.  

  BEEP was moved to Code:Machio.Lisp, and there's a couple different
  beeping methods in here now that get called as a result of
  *beep-function* being bound by SITE-WRAPPER-MACRO.  HEMLOCK-WINDOW calls
  *hemlock-window-mngt* when *current-window* is bound, which happens going
  in and out of Hemlock.

  The X scan code translation mechanism lives here, but the initialization
  is in Keytran.Lisp.  Terminal translation now downcases control
  characters to interact more smoothly with the new Hemlock key translation
  and binding scheme.

  There are now different types of editor input streams that all a head and
  tail pointer into an input queue of events.  One is used for terminals
  and flat bitmap screens, and the other uses SERVER for windowed input
  under X.  TEXT-CHARACTER is new and now more correct.

  There is a page of X support: getting a Hemlock cursor, setting up a grey
  pixmap for border frobbing, cut buffer manipulation, and naming windows.

/usr2/lisp/xhem/owindow.lisp, 12-May-87 00:52:54, Edit by Chiles
  This file used to be Window.Lisp.  It now contains only the old bitmap
  related code for setting up a windows image.

/usr2/lisp/xhem/ofont.lisp, 12-May-87 00:51:35, Edit by Chiles
  This file used to be Font.Lisp.  It now contains only the few things
  necessary for old bitmap font interfacing.

/usr2/lisp/xhem/obit-screen.lisp, 12-May-87 00:43:50, Edit by Chiles
  This file used to be Screen-Bit.Lisp.  Shared stuff has been moved to
  the new file by the old name.  Window creation and deletion methods now
  set *screen-image-trashed* since this is not meaningful across all
  devices.

/usr2/lisp/xhem/obit-display.lisp, 12-May-87 00:40:35, Edit by Chiles
  This file used to be Bit-Display.Lisp.  Shared stuff has been moved to
  the new file by the old name.

/usr2/lisp/xhem/macros.lisp, 12-May-87 00:35:30, Edit by Chiles
  WITH-RANDOM-TYPEOUT has been modified to handle new termination
  functionality involved with running Hemlock under X.
  LISP-ERROR-ERROR-HANDLER no longer calls REDISPLAY after returning from a
  BREAK.  This is the responsibility of the device's init method if it is
  necessary.

/usr2/lisp/xhem/keytran.lisp, 12-May-87 00:30:18, Edit by Chiles
  This is a new file.  It contains the initialization of the keyboard
  translations for Hemlock running under X.  These were too numerous to
  leave in Rompsite since there is no hack for generating the translations.

/usr2/lisp/xhem/hunk-draw.lisp, 12-May-87 00:28:02, Edit by Chiles
  This is a new file, a kin to Pane.Lisp.  It contains screen painting
  routines for Hemlock running under X windows.  This includes cursor and
  border manipulation.

/usr2/lisp/xhem/font.lisp, 12-May-87 00:12:10, Edit by Chiles
  This is a new file, replacing the currently named Ofont.Lisp.  It
  contains the pseudo-independent Hemlock font information implementation.
  This includes stuff particular for running Hemlock under X windows and
  stuff that is used by the other bitmap redisplay/screen manager code.

/usr2/lisp/xhem/display.lisp, 12-May-87 00:09:23, Edit by Chiles
  The device structure has been modified to handle new methods, such as
  beeping and finishing output.  The device-clear method is now optional.
  The entry points into redisplay have been modified to encorporate the
  needs of Hemlock running under X windows.

/usr2/lisp/xhem/bit-screen.lisp, 11-May-87 23:16:26, Edit by Chiles
  This is a new file, replacing the currently named Obit-Screen.Lisp.  It
  contains the event handlers for selected events on Hemlock windows, the
  screen management methods for Hemlock running under X windows, the random
  typeout methods, and screen manager initialization.

/usr2/lisp/xhem/bit-hunk-stream.lisp, 11-May-87 22:43:36, Edit by Chiles
  This is a new file.  It contains the bitmap-hunk-output-stream structure
  definition and the associated methods.  This is used for random typeout.

/usr2/lisp/xhem/bit-display.lisp, 11-May-87 22:38:47, Edit by Chiles
  This is a new file, replacing the currently named Obit-Display.Lisp.  It
  contains the bitmap-hunk structure and the X related redisplay methods.d 

/usr1/ram/cursor.lisp, 08-May-87 05:02:09, Edit by Ram
  Totally rewrote dis-line-offset-guess, making it dramatically simpler and
  more correct by making it do only what is needed for the scrolling functions,
  rather than attempting to make it preserve position within the line.

/../chiles/usr/lisp/hemlock/bindings.lisp, 29-Apr-87 23:33:27, Edit by Ram
  Massively revised bindings now that we have key-translations and a real meta
  key.  C-Z and Escape are now handled as bit-prefix characters, so all
  explicit bindings containing these have been flushed.  Key translations are
  used to make things case-insensitive, so duplicate bindings for different
  case have been flushed.

  All the C-<punctuation>/Escape <punctuation> bindings pairs have been
  replaced with M-<punctuation>.  This is the main user-interface change.  Also
  the commands previously bound to C-Z M-<char> have been rebound to C-M-<CHAR>
  (i.e. control meta shift).  This is necessary since C-Z M-<char> is just
  C-M-<char> due to the bit prefix mechanism.  We selectively flush the
  uppercasing translation for the control meta chars used in this way.

  In a more rt-specific change, uses of Help have been replaced with Home.

/usr/ram/interp.lisp, 30-Apr-87 00:36:04, Edit by Ram
  New Key-Translation mechanism replaces key links.  A key translation
  specifies a substitution that is done one key arguments to the bindings
  functions.  When the translated-from key appears as a subsequence of the key
  to be translated, that subsequence is replaced with the translation.  There
  is also a mechanism for defining bit-prefix characters.

  The key-table code has been changed a fair amount.  Key-tables are now
  structures.  The conditionalization off of the commands-bits feature has been
  flushed.  Keys are no longer internally assumed to be simple-vectors so that
  we can use vectors with fill-pointers as internal buffers.

  Also put in a few doc strings and made crunch-key allow any seqence and check
  that the components are characters.  The type check was in the PERQ version
  but got lost.

/usr/ram/spellcoms.slisp, 12-Apr-87 10:57:44, Edit by Ram
  Fixed Spell-Replace-Word not to consider words beginning with #\' to be
  capitalized.

/../wb1/usr/chiles/nhem/lispmode.slisp, 04-Apr-87 22:44:36, Edit by Chiles
  Modified "Transpose Forms" such that
     (form1)       ;comment

/../wb1/usr/chiles/nhem/tty-display.slisp, 26-Mar-87 18:51:40, Edit by Chiles
  Fixed bug in TTY-SEMI-DUMB-WINDOW-REDISPLAY and
  TTY-SMART-WINDOW-REDISPLAY that came up when writing the modeline.  Put
  in an UNWIND-PROTECT around TTY-SMART-LINE-REDISPLAY since it can throw
  out of redisplay leaving the terminal in standout mode.

/../wb1/usr/chiles/nhem/htext1.slisp, 26-Mar-87 18:10:15, Edit by Chiles
  Modified MODIFYING-BUFFER to invoke new "Buffer Modified Hook" when the
  buffer went from unmodified to modified.

/../wb1/usr/chiles/nhem/main.slisp, 26-Mar-87 17:49:12, Edit by Chiles
  Added definition for "Buffer Modified Hook" and changed definition for
  "Default Modeline String".

/../wb1/usr/chiles/nhem/window.slisp, 26-Mar-87 17:37:32, Edit by Chiles
  Made %INIT-REDISPLAY add QUEUE-BUFFER-CHANGES to new "Buffer Modified Hook".
  Made DEFAULT-MODELINE-FUNCTION-FUNCTION return one more value, whether
  the buffer is modified.

/../wb1/usr/chiles/nhem/buffer.slisp, 26-Mar-87 18:14:08, Edit by Chiles
  Made %SET-BUFFER-MODIFIED to invoke new "Buffer Modified Hook" on sense.

/usr1/ram/group.slisp, 20-Mar-87 14:10:56, Edit by Ram
  Changed the "Group Search" commands to feel more like the "Query Replace"
  commands.  :Yes now exits instead of skipping, skipping is moved to :No and
  skipping the rest of the file is move to :Do-All.

/usr/ram/searchcoms.slisp, 19-Mar-87 00:04:09, Edit by Ram
  Changed query-replace-function to set up the search pattern itself.  Also
  made it error if the count is specified and negative, rather than trying to
  do replacement backwards and getting it wrong.  Also restore the search
  pattern after a recursive edit.

/usr/ram/group.slisp, 19-Mar-87 00:31:13, Edit by Ram
  Fixed up a bunch of things.  Indirect filespecs are parsed normally; it is no
  longer assumed that the rest of the line is the name of the file.  The
  default file name is no longer capitalized.  Temporary search buffers are no
  longer renamed to "Group Search", making exiting from searches more
  well-defined.  "Group Search" restores the search pattern after a recursive
  edit.

/usr/lisp/nhem/lispmode.slisp, 12-Mar-87 16:05:30, Edit by Chiles
  Rewrote TOP-LEVEL-OFFSET to be correct and to not move the mark unless it
  could really do the offset.  Modified INSIDE-DEFUN-P to not return t when
  point is between a top level form and the beginning of the buffer.  Added
  START-DEFUN-P to be used in heavily modified versions of "End of Defun"
  and "Mark Defun" commands.

/../wb1/usr/chiles/nhem/lispmode.slisp, 03-Mar-87 17:33:05, Edit by Chiles
  Fixed LISP-INDENTATION to do a "generic" indent instead of simply
  returning 0.  This fixes doc strings.

/../wb1/usr/chiles/nhem/indent.slisp, 27-Feb-87 14:18:59, Edit by Chiles
  Fixed "Indent" command to only affect argument number of lines (instead
  of one too many) when the prefix argument is supplied.  Rewrote
  INDENT-REGION-FOR-COMMANDS to be much simpler, fixing a couple
  irritatingly buggy special cases.

/../wb1/usr/chiles/nhem/fill.slisp, 27-Feb-87 12:18:50, Edit by Chiles
  Fixed "Fill Paragrah" command's undoability.  When a prefix was added to
  the first line, it was ignored by the undo region do to a :left-inserting
  mark.

/usr1/ram/text.slisp, 23-Feb-87 11:00:53, Edit by Ram
  The "Paragraph Delimiter Function" variable is now used to determine whether
  a line is a paragraph break.  This is used by Scribe mode.

/usr1/ram/spellcoms.slisp, 23-Feb-87 10:52:18, Edit by Ram
  "Spell Correct Unique Spelling Immediately" (on by default) causes an unknown
  word with only one correction to be corrected immediately in auto-spell mode,
  rather than requiring "Correct Last Misspelled Word" to be done.

  The "Undo Last Spelling Correction" command undoes the last incremental
  spelling correction and places the word in the dictionary.

  "Spell Ignore Uppercase" (off by default) causes all-uppercase unknown words
  to be ignored.

/usr1/ram/defsyn.slisp, 23-Feb-87 10:50:01, Edit by Ram
  Changed definition of "Lisp Syntax" attribute for new Lisp mode primitives.

/usr1/ram/lispbuf.slisp, 23-Feb-87 10:48:54, Edit by Ram
  Changed to use new Lisp mode primitives. 

/usr1/ram/htext1.slisp, 23-Feb-87 10:19:19, Edit by Ram
  Deleted old line-plist support.  The user directly accesses the Plist slot
  now that he is responsible for keeping treack of when it changes. 

/usr1/ram/line.slisp, 23-Feb-87 10:17:30, Edit by Ram
  Merged in code to implement the documented line-plist/line-signature
  semantics.  This code somehow never got merged in from the PERQ version.

/usr1/ram/scribe.slisp, 20-Feb-87 16:25:07, Edit by Ram
  A real Scribe mode.  Has general bracket balancing, and knows about paragraph
  boundaries.  Also various commands for inserting Scribe directives bound to
  C-H mumble.

/usr1/ram/bindings.slisp, 20-Feb-87 14:22:45, Edit by Ram
  New bindings for "Undo Last Spelling Correction" and Scribe mode commands.

/usr1/ram/lispmode.slisp, 18-Feb-87 11:42:22, Edit by Ram
  New Lisp mode primitives, courtesy of Ivan (Crash and burn like an unblanced
  paren Vazquez.  These primitives know about Lisp commenting and quotation
  conventions, and ignoring meaningless parens and quotes.  This is done by
  pre-parsing the lines in the buffer, annotating them with information about
  the quoted areas on the line.  Forward-Form and Backward-Form are gone,
  replaced by Form-Offset.  Similarly, Forward-List and Backward-List are
  replaced by List-Offset.

  All users of these Lisp parsing primitives must call Pre-Command-Parse-Check
  or equivalent to ensure that the buffer is properly annotated.  This function
  calls the values of "Parse Start Function" and "Parse End Function" to
  determine the area of the buffer to parse.  The default parse start and end
  functions use "Minimum Lines Parsed", "Maximum Lines Parsed" and
  "Defun Parse Goal" to determine how much stuff to parse.

  I also reimplemented Lisp indentation.  Other than general cleanup, use of
  newly avilable syntax information, and bug fixes, the major changes are:
   -- Unless there is a reason otherwise, indentation for a form will be copied
      from the previous form.
   -- If no special args appear on the same line with the form name, then the
      special args are indented four spaces.  This is useful with
      Unwind-Protect and Multiple-Value-Bind.
   -- DEFxxx is now uniformly treated as a two-arg special form, rather than
      being bizzarely special-cased.  "Indent Defanything" controls this
      behavior.
   -- Lines in the middle of a quoted string are not indented, rather than
      being indented as though they were lines of code.  This eliminates
      spurious whitespace in multi-line strings.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/termcap.slisp, 17-Feb-87 12:04:32, Edit by Chiles
  Made GET-TERMCAP handle TERMCAP environment variable.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/rompsite.slisp, 17-Feb-87 11:48:16, Edit by Chiles
  Modified SITE-WRAPPER-MACRO to call init/exit methods out of the device.
  EDITOR-LISTEN now loops a parameter number of times which can be set when
  using a slow line to make sure the editor listens for input before
  wasting redisplay effort.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/tty-display.slisp, 16-Feb-87 17:05:01, Edit by Chiles
  Added "semi dumb" terminal redisplay.  This is used for terminals without
  add line and delete line.  Made INIT-TTY-DEVICE (renamed) and
  EXIT-TTY-DEVICE (renamed) call standard init/exit function from
  Rompsite.Slisp.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/macros.slisp, 14-Feb-87 01:33:08, Edit by Chiles
  Made LISP-ERROR-ERROR-HANDLER call init/exit methods out of the device
  when going in and out of Hemlock.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/bit-screen.slisp, 14-Feb-87 01:08:15, Edit by Chiles
  Added INIT-BITMAP-DEVICE and EXIT-BITMAP-DEVICE.  Now whenever the editor
  is exited or entered there is a method to be called in the device
  structure.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/main.slisp, 14-Feb-87 00:27:47, Edit by Chiles

  This is a new file.  The previous contents are now in Bit-Screen.Slisp --
  see log entry below.  This file contains new %INIT-SCREEN-MANAGER,
  PREPARE-FOR-RANDOM-TYPEOUT, and RANDOM-TYPEOUT-CLEANUP functions, and it
  contains new window operations that dispatch off the device structure --
  MAKE-WINDOW, NEXT-WINDOW, PREVIOUS-WINDOW, and DELETE-WINDOW.

/usr/lisp/hemlock/rompsite.slisp, 11-Jan-87 16:06:26, Edit by Chiles
  Organized file into logical partitions with page markers.  Added
  *editor-console-input* to be used in GET-EDITOR-INPUT, which should go
  away when we are on a window system -- maybe a device method for
  translating input characters or even getting them.  Modified INIT-RAW-IO
  to set *editor-console-input*.  Modified SITE-WRAPPER-MACRO, so it does
  not signal an error if it cannot find a bitmap device.  Added terminal
  character translation tables and TTY-TRANSLATE-CHAR.  Added
  SLEEP-FOR-TIME to be used in input stuff and SHOW-MARK.  Rewrote
  SHOW-MARK code to dispatch off of device.  Added functions CONSOLEP and
  GET-TERMINAL-NAME for use in Screen.Slisp.  Modified BUILD-HEMLOCK to be
  consistent with new files.

  Created from old Screen.Slisp.  Removed functions MAKE-WINDOW,
  NEXT-WINDOW, PREVIOUS-WINDOW, DELETE-WINDOW, PREPARE-FOR-RANDOM-TYPEOUT,

  bitmap device funs, bitmap-hunk structure definition, new initialization
  function for bitmap screen management, new bitmap window operation
  methods (make, delete, next, previous), and new random typeout setup and
  cleanup for bitmaps.  Deleted screen-hunk structure definition.

/usr/slisp/hemlock/spell-rt.slisp, 22-Oct-86 17:38:27, Edit by Chiles
  Created this file to contain implementation dependent spelling code.

/usr/slisp/hemlock/bindings.slisp, 22-Oct-86 17:35:48, Edit by Chiles
  Used the new DO-ALPHA-CHARS macro from Charmacs.Slisp to do key linking.
  Also, uncommented the spelling bindings.

/usr/slisp/hemlock/edit-defs.slisp, 11-Oct-16 16:56:45, Edit by Chiles
  Created this file to contain the stuff just removed from Lispmode.Slisp.

/usr/slisp/hemlock/lispmode.slisp, 10-Oct-16 12:53:41, Edit by Chiles
  Rewrote GET-DEFINITION-FILE to match longer, more specific directory
  specification before matching shorter, less specific specifications.
  Before it only matched whole directory namestrings.

  Removed all of the definition editing code form Lispmode.slisp.

/sys/slisp/hemlock/macros.slisp#1, 08-Sep-86 01:15:37, Edit by Chiles
  Made error handling stuff use the new error system.

/sys/slisp/hemlock/morecoms.slisp#1, 27-Aug-86 10:51:27, Edit by Chiles
  Modified "View Page Directory" and "Insert Page Directory" to be smarter
  when creating a pop-up window and to be more general with respect to a
  :page-delimiter character that is not also a :whitespace character.

/sys/slisp/hemlock/filecoms.slisp#1, 26-Aug-86 16:18:09, Edit by Chiles
  Modified WRITE-DA-FILE to display the buffer's name when prompting about
  tacking a newline at the end of the file.

/sys/slisp/hemlock/filecoms.slisp#1, 05-Aug-86 18:17:17, Edit by Chiles
  Added *buffer-history-ptr* and modified "Select Previous Buffer" to walk
  down *buffer-history* (when called repeatedly with an argument), selecting
  successively previous buffers while leaving *buffer-history* unchanged.

/sys/slisp/hemlock/Bindings.slisp#1, 26-Jul-86 10:57:47, Edit by Chiles
  Added bindings:
     (bind-key "Kill Previous Word" #\meta-backspace)
     (bind-key "Echo Area Kill Previous Word" #\meta-backspace)
     (bind-key "Complete Keyword" #\altmode :mode "Echo Area")
  The last one is added in case you hit Esc, see nothing happened, and hit
  it again.  It doesn't hurt to bind this even if you have to hit Esc Esc
  to get it to work.

/sys/slisp/hemlock/lispmode.slisp#1, 25-Jul-86 11:49:43, Edit by Chiles
  Fixed bug involving a comment starting after a function name and the
  first argument being lined up with the comment instead of under the
  function name; for example:
     (cond (special-arg-p ; comment this cond branch
                          (first-thing-in-branch arg)
			  ...)
     becomes
     (cond (special-arg-p ; comment this cond branch
            (first-thing-in-branch arg)
	    ...)
  Note, this is somewhat kludged since a #|...|# comment will still
  generate bogus indentation, but the whole LISP-INDENTATION algorithm
  needs to be revamped anyway.

  "End of Defun" never worked since it was believed that MARK-AFTER was
  enough to cause NEXT-TOP-LEVEL to move its argument mark, but actually
  the use of LINE-OFFSET is required.

/sys/slisp/hemlock/lispmode.slisp#1, 23-Jul-86 10:20:29, Edit by Chiles
  Made LISP-INDENTATION check that the paren was on the start of a line
  before doing the "DEF" hack with *indent-defanything*.

/sys/slisp/hemlock/echo.slisp#1, 15-Jul-86 12:10:21, Edit by Chiles
  Missed :trim argument to PROMPT-FOR-STRING while merging.

  two Lisps.  The files things were taken from were:
       abbrev.slisp
       bindings.slisp
       command.slisp
       comments.slisp        
       echo.slisp
       filecoms.slisp
       fill.slisp
       group.slisp
       indent.slisp
       kbdmac.slisp
       killcoms.slisp
       lispbuf.slisp
       lispeval.slisp
       lispmode.slisp
       main.slisp
       morecoms.slisp
       overwrite.slisp
