\chapter{The Compiler}

\section{Compiler Introduction}

This chapter contains information about the compiler that every \cmucl{} user
should be familiar with.  Chapter \ref{advanced-compiler} goes into greater
depth, describing ways to use more advanced features.

The \cmucl{} compiler (also known as \python{}, not to be confused
with the programming language of the same name) has many features
that are seldom or never supported by conventional \llisp{}
compilers:

\begin{itemize} 
\item Source level debugging of compiled code (see chapter
  \ref{debugger}.)
  
\item Type error compiler warnings for type errors detectable at
  compile time.
  
\item Compiler error messages that provide a good indication of where
  the error appeared in the source.
  
\item Full run-time checking of all potential type errors, with
  optimization of type checks to minimize the cost.
  
\item Scheme-like features such as proper tail recursion and extensive
  source-level optimization.
  
\item Advanced tuning and optimization features such as comprehensive
  efficiency notes, flow analysis, and untagged number representations
  (see chapter \ref{advanced-compiler}.)
\end{itemize}


\section{Calling the Compiler}
\cindex{compiling}

Functions may be compiled using \code{compile}, \code{compile-file}, or 
\code{compile-from-stream}.  

\begin{defun}{}{compile}{ \args{\var{name} \ampoptional{} \var{definition}}}
  
  This function compiles the function whose name is \var{name}.  If
  \var{name} is \false, the compiled function object is returned.  If
  \var{definition} is supplied, it should be a lambda expression that
  is to be compiled and then placed in the function cell of
  \var{name}.  As per the proposed X3J13 cleanup
  ``compile-argument-problems'', \var{definition} may also be an
  interpreted function.
  
  The return values are as per the proposed X3J13 cleanup
  ``compiler-diagnostics''.  The first value is the function name or
  function object.  The second value is \false{} if no compiler
  diagnostics were issued, and \true{} otherwise.  The third value is
  \false{} if no compiler diagnostics other than style warnings were
  issued.  A non-\false{} value indicates that there were ``serious''
  compiler diagnostics issued, or that other conditions of type
  \tindexed{error} or \tindexed{warning} (but not
  \tindexed{style-warning}) were signaled during compilation.
\end{defun}


\begin{defun}{}{compile-file}{
    \args{\var{input-pathname}
      \keys{\kwd{output-file} \kwd{error-file} \kwd{trace-file}}
      \morekeys{\kwd{error-output} \kwd{verbose} \kwd{print} \kwd{progress}}
      \yetmorekeys{\kwd{load} \kwd{block-compile} \kwd{entry-points}}
      \yetmorekeys{\kwd{byte-compile}}}}
  
  The \cmucl{} \code{compile-file} is extended through the addition of
  several new keywords and an additional interpretation of
  \var{input-pathname}:
  \begin{Lentry}
    
  \item[\var{input-pathname}] If this argument is a list of input
    files, rather than a single input pathname, then all the source
    files are compiled into a single object file.  In this case, the
    name of the first file is used to determine the default output
    file names.  This is especially useful in combination with
    \var{block-compile}.
    
  \item[\kwd{output-file}] This argument specifies the name of the
    output file.  \true{} gives the default name, \false{} suppresses
    the output file.
    
  \item[\kwd{error-file}] A listing of all the error output is
    directed to this file.  If there are no errors, then no error file
    is produced (and any existing error file is deleted.)  \true{}
    gives \w{"\var{name}\code{.err}"} (the default), and \false{}
    suppresses the output file.
    
  \item[\kwd{error-output}] If \true{} (the default), then error
    output is sent to \code{*error-output*}.  If a stream, then output
    is sent to that stream instead.  If \false, then error output is
    suppressed.  Note that this error output is in addition to (but
    the same as) the output placed in the \var{error-file}.
    
  \item[\kwd{verbose}] If \true{} (the default), then the compiler
    prints to error output at the start and end of compilation of each
    file.  See \varref{compile-verbose}.
    
  \item[\kwd{print}] If \true{} (the default), then the compiler
    prints to error output when each function is compiled.  See
    \varref{compile-print}.
    
  \item[\kwd{progress}] If \true{} (default \false{}), then the
    compiler prints to error output progress information about the
    phases of compilation of each function.  This is a \cmucl{} extension
    that is useful mainly in large block compilations.  See
    \varref{compile-progress}.
    
  \item[\kwd{trace-file}] If \true{}, several of the intermediate
    representations (including annotated assembly code) are dumped out
    to this file.  \true{} gives \w{"\var{name}\code{.trace}"}.  Trace
    output is off by default.  \xlref{trace-files}.
    
  \item[\kwd{load}] If \true{}, load the resulting output file.
    
  \item[\kwd{block-compile}] Controls the compile-time resolution of
    function calls.  By default, only self-recursive calls are
    resolved, unless an \code{ext:block-start} declaration appears in
    the source file.  \xlref{compile-file-block}.
    
  \item[\kwd{entry-points}] If non-null, then this is a list of the
    names of all functions in the file that should have global
    definitions installed (because they are referenced in other
    files.)  \xlref{compile-file-block}.
    
  \item[\kwd{byte-compile}] If \true{}, compiling to a compact
    interpreted byte code is enabled.  Possible values are \true{},
    \false{}, and \kwd{maybe} (the default.)  See
    \varref{byte-compile-default} and \xlref{byte-compile}.
  \end{Lentry}
  
  The return values are as per the proposed X3J13 cleanup
  ``compiler-diagnostics''.  The first value from \code{compile-file}
  is the truename of the output file, or \false{} if the file could
  not be created.  The interpretation of the second and third values
  is described above for \code{compile}.
\end{defun}

\begin{defvar}{}{compile-verbose}
  \defvarx{compile-print}
  \defvarx{compile-progress}
  
  These variables determine the default values for the \kwd{verbose},
  \kwd{print} and \kwd{progress} arguments to \code{compile-file}.
\end{defvar}

\begin{defun}{extensions:}{compile-from-stream}{%
    \args{\var{input-stream}
      \keys{\kwd{error-stream}}
      \morekeys{\kwd{trace-stream}}
      \yetmorekeys{\kwd{block-compile} \kwd{entry-points}}
      \yetmorekeys{\kwd{byte-compile}}}}
  
  This function is similar to \code{compile-file}, but it takes all
  its arguments as streams.  It reads \llisp{} code from
  \var{input-stream} until end of file is reached, compiling into the
  current environment.  This function returns the same two values as
  the last two values of \code{compile}.  No output files are
  produced.
\end{defun}


\section{Compilation Units}
\cpsubindex{compilation}{units}

\cmucl{} supports the \code{with-compilation-unit} macro added to the
language by the X3J13 ``with-compilation-unit'' compiler cleanup
issue.  This provides a mechanism for eliminating spurious undefined
warnings when there are forward references across files, and also
provides a standard way to access compiler extensions.

\begin{defmac}{}{with-compilation-unit}{%
    \args{(\mstar{\var{key} \var{value}}) \mstar{\var{form}}}}
  
  This macro evaluates the \var{forms} in an environment that causes
  warnings for undefined variables, functions and types to be delayed
  until all the forms have been evaluated.  Each keyword \var{value}
  is an evaluated form.  These keyword options are recognized:
  \begin{Lentry}
  
  \item[\kwd{override}] If uses of \code{with-compilation-unit} are
    dynamically nested, the outermost use will take precedence,
    suppressing printing of undefined warnings by inner uses.
    However, when the \code{override} option is true this shadowing is
    inhibited; an inner use will print summary warnings for the
    compilations within the inner scope.
  
  \item[\kwd{optimize}] This is a \cmucl{} extension that specifies of the
    ``global'' compilation policy for the dynamic extent of the body.
    The argument should evaluate to an \code{optimize} declare form,
    like:
    \begin{lisp}
      (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0))
    \end{lisp}
    \xlref{optimize-declaration}
  
  \item[\kwd{optimize-interface}] Similar to \kwd{optimize}, but
    specifies the compilation policy for function interfaces (argument
    count and type checking) for the dynamic extent of the body.
    \xlref{optimize-interface-declaration}.
  
  \item[\kwd{context-declarations}] This is a \cmucl{} extension that
    pattern-matches on function names, automatically splicing in any
    appropriate declarations at the head of the function definition.
    \xlref{context-declarations}.
  \end{Lentry}
\end{defmac}


\subsection{Undefined Warnings}

\cindex{undefined warnings}
Warnings about undefined variables, functions and types are delayed until the
end of the current compilation unit.  The compiler entry functions
(\code{compile}, etc.) implicitly use \code{with-compilation-unit}, so undefined
warnings will be printed at the end of the compilation unless there is an
enclosing \code{with-compilation-unit}.  In order the gain the benefit of this
mechanism, you should wrap a single \code{with-compilation-unit} around the calls
to \code{compile-file}, i.e.:
\begin{lisp}
(with-compilation-unit ()
  (compile-file "file1")
  (compile-file "file2")
  ...)
\end{lisp}

Unlike for functions and types, undefined warnings for variables are
not suppressed when a definition (e.g. \code{defvar}) appears after
the reference (but in the same compilation unit.)  This is because
doing special declarations out of order just doesn't
work\dash{}although early references will be compiled as special,
bindings will be done lexically.

Undefined warnings are printed with full source context
(\pxlref{error-messages}), which tremendously simplifies the problem
of finding undefined references that resulted from macroexpansion.
After printing detailed information about the undefined uses of each
name, \code{with-compilation-unit} also prints summary listings of the
names of all the undefined functions, types and variables.

\begin{defvar}{}{undefined-warning-limit}
  
  This variable controls the number of undefined warnings for each
  distinct name that are printed with full source context when the
  compilation unit ends.  If there are more undefined references than
  this, then they are condensed into a single warning:
  \begin{example}
    Warning: \var{count} more uses of undefined function \var{name}.
  \end{example}
  When the value is \code{0}, then the undefined warnings are not
  broken down by name at all: only the summary listing of undefined
  names is printed.
\end{defvar}


\section{Interpreting Error Messages}
\label{error-messages}
\cpsubindex{error messages}{compiler}
\cindex{compiler error messages}

One of \python{}'s unique features is the level of source location
information it provides in error messages.  The error messages contain
a lot of detail in a terse format, to they may be confusing at first.
Error messages will be illustrated using this example program:
\begin{lisp}
(defmacro zoq (x)
  `(roq (ploq (+ ,x 3))))

(defun foo (y)
  (declare (symbol y))
  (zoq y))
\end{lisp}
The main problem with this program is that it is trying to add \code{3} to a
symbol.  Note also that the functions \code{roq} and \code{ploq} aren't defined
anywhere.


\subsection{The Parts of the Error Message}

The compiler will produce this warning:

\begin{example}
File: /usr/me/stuff.lisp
In: DEFUN FOO
  (ZOQ Y)
--> ROQ PLOQ + 
==>
  Y
Warning: Result is a SYMBOL, not a NUMBER.
\end{example}

In this example we see each of the six possible parts of a compiler error
message:

\begin{Lentry} 
\item[\w{\code{File: /usr/me/stuff.lisp}}] This is the \var{file} that
  the compiler read the relevant code from.  The file name is
  displayed because it may not be immediately obvious when there is an
  error during compilation of a large system, especially when
  \code{with-compilation-unit} is used to delay undefined warnings.
  
\item[\w{\code{In: DEFUN FOO}}] This is the \var{definition} or
  top-level form responsible for the error.  It is obtained by taking
  the first two elements of the enclosing form whose first element is
  a symbol beginning with ``\code{DEF}''.  If there is no enclosing
  \w{\var{def}mumble}, then the outermost form is used.  If there are
  multiple \w{\var{def}mumbles}, then they are all printed from the
  out in, separated by \code{$=>$}'s.  In this example, the problem
  was in the \code{defun} for \code{foo}.
  
\item[\w{\code{(ZOQ Y)}}] This is the {\em original source} form
  responsible for the error.  Original source means that the form
  directly appeared in the original input to the compiler, i.e. in the
  lambda passed to \code{compile} or the top-level form read from the
  source file.  In this example, the expansion of the \code{zoq} macro
  was responsible for the error.
  
\item[\w{\code{--$>$ ROQ PLOQ +}} ] This is the {\em processing path}
  that the compiler used to produce the errorful code.  The processing
  path is a representation of the evaluated forms enclosing the actual
  source that the compiler encountered when processing the original
  source.  The path is the first element of each form, or the form
  itself if the form is not a list.  These forms result from the
  expansion of macros or source-to-source transformation done by the
  compiler.  In this example, the enclosing evaluated forms are the
  calls to \code{roq}, \code{ploq} and \code{+}.  These calls resulted
  from the expansion of the \code{zoq} macro.
  
\item[\code{==$>$ Y}] This is the {\em actual source} responsible for
  the error.  If the actual source appears in the explanation, then we
  print the next enclosing evaluated form, instead of printing the
  actual source twice.  (This is the form that would otherwise have
  been the last form of the processing path.)  In this example, the
  problem is with the evaluation of the reference to the variable
  \code{y}.
  
\item[\w{\code{Warning: Result is a SYMBOL, not a NUMBER.}}]  This is
  the \var{explanation} the problem.  In this example, the problem is
  that \code{y} evaluates to a \code{symbol}, but is in a context
  where a number is required (the argument to \code{+}).
\end{Lentry}

Note that each part of the error message is distinctively marked:

\begin{itemize} 
\item \code{File:} and \code{In:} mark the file and definition,
  respectively.
  
\item The original source is an indented form with no prefix.
  
\item Each line of the processing path is prefixed with \code{--$>$}.
  
\item The actual source form is indented like the original source, but
  is marked by a preceding \code{==$>$} line.  This is like the
  ``macroexpands to'' notation used in \cltl.
  
\item The explanation is prefixed with the error severity
  (\pxlref{error-severity}), either \code{Error:}, \code{Warning:}, or
  \code{Note:}.
\end{itemize}


Each part of the error message is more specific than the preceding
one.  If consecutive error messages are for nearby locations, then the
front part of the error messages would be the same.  In this case, the
compiler omits as much of the second message as in common with the
first.  For example:

\begin{example}
File: /usr/me/stuff.lisp
In: DEFUN FOO
  (ZOQ Y)
--> ROQ 
==>
  (PLOQ (+ Y 3))
Warning: Undefined function: PLOQ

==>
  (ROQ (PLOQ (+ Y 3)))
Warning: Undefined function: ROQ
\end{example}

In this example, the file, definition and original source are
identical for the two messages, so the compiler omits them in the
second message.  If consecutive messages are entirely identical, then
the compiler prints only the first message, followed by:

\begin{example}
[Last message occurs \var{repeats} times]
\end{example}

where \var{repeats} is the number of times the message was given.

If the source was not from a file, then no file line is printed.  If
the actual source is the same as the original source, then the
processing path and actual source will be omitted.  If no forms
intervene between the original source and the actual source, then the
processing path will also be omitted.


\subsection{The Original and Actual Source}
\cindex{original source}
\cindex{actual source}

The {\em original source} displayed will almost always be a list.  If the actual
source for an error message is a symbol, the original source will be the
immediately enclosing evaluated list form.  So even if the offending symbol
does appear in the original source, the compiler will print the enclosing list
and then print the symbol as the actual source (as though the symbol were
introduced by a macro.)

When the {\em actual source} is displayed (and is not a symbol), it will always
be code that resulted from the expansion of a macro or a source-to-source
compiler optimization.  This is code that did not appear in the original
source program; it was introduced by the compiler.

Keep in mind that when the compiler displays a source form in an error message,
it always displays the most specific (innermost) responsible form.  For
example, compiling this function:

\begin{lisp}
(defun bar (x)
  (let (a)
    (declare (fixnum a))
    (setq a (foo x))
    a))
\end{lisp}

gives this error message:

\begin{example}
In: DEFUN BAR
  (LET (A) (DECLARE (FIXNUM A)) (SETQ A (FOO X)) A)
Warning: The binding of A is not a FIXNUM:
  NIL
\end{example}

This error message is not saying ``there's a problem somewhere in this
\code{let}''\dash{}it is saying that there is a problem with the
\code{let} itself.  In this example, the problem is that \code{a}'s
\false{} initial value is not a \code{fixnum}.


\subsection{The Processing Path}
\cindex{processing path}
\cindex{macroexpansion}
\cindex{source-to-source transformation}

The processing path is mainly useful for debugging macros, so if you don't
write macros, you can ignore the processing path.  Consider this example:

\begin{lisp}
(defun foo (n)
  (dotimes (i n *undefined*)))
\end{lisp}

Compiling results in this error message:

\begin{example}
In: DEFUN FOO
  (DOTIMES (I N *UNDEFINED*))
--> DO BLOCK LET TAGBODY RETURN-FROM 
==>
  (PROGN *UNDEFINED*)
Warning: Undefined variable: *UNDEFINED*
\end{example}

Note that \code{do} appears in the processing path.  This is because \code{dotimes}
expands into:

\begin{lisp}
(do ((i 0 (1+ i)) (#:g1 n))
    ((>= i #:g1) *undefined*)
  (declare (type unsigned-byte i)))
\end{lisp}

The rest of the processing path results from the expansion of \code{do}:

\begin{lisp}
(block nil
  (let ((i 0) (#:g1 n))
    (declare (type unsigned-byte i))
    (tagbody (go #:g3)
     #:g2    (psetq i (1+ i))
     #:g3    (unless (>= i #:g1) (go #:g2))
             (return-from nil (progn *undefined*)))))
\end{lisp}

In this example, the compiler descended into the \code{block},
\code{let}, \code{tagbody} and \code{return-from} to reach the
\code{progn} printed as the actual source.  This is a place where the
``actual source appears in explanation'' rule was applied.  The
innermost actual source form was the symbol \code{*undefined*} itself,
but that also appeared in the explanation, so the compiler backed out
one level.


\subsection{Error Severity}
\label{error-severity}
\cindex{severity of compiler errors}
\cindex{compiler error severity}

There are three levels of compiler error severity:

\begin{Lentry}  
\item[Error] This severity is used when the compiler encounters a
  problem serious enough to prevent normal processing of a form.
  Instead of compiling the form, the compiler compiles a call to
  \code{error}.  Errors are used mainly for signaling syntax errors.
  If an error happens during macroexpansion, the compiler will handle
  it.  The compiler also handles and attempts to proceed from read
  errors.
  
\item[Warning] Warnings are used when the compiler can prove that
  something bad will happen if a portion of the program is executed,
  but the compiler can proceed by compiling code that signals an error
  at runtime if the problem has not been fixed:
  \begin{itemize}
  
  \item Violation of type declarations, or
  
  \item Function calls that have the wrong number of arguments or
    malformed keyword argument lists, or
  
  \item Referencing a variable declared \code{ignore}, or unrecognized
    declaration specifiers.
  \end{itemize}
  
  In the language of the \clisp{} standard, these are situations where
  the compiler can determine that a situation with undefined
  consequences or that would cause an error to be signaled would
  result at runtime.
  
\item[Note] Notes are used when there is something that seems a bit
  odd, but that might reasonably appear in correct programs.
\end{Lentry}

Note that the compiler does not fully conform to the proposed X3J13
``compiler-diagnostics'' cleanup.  Errors, warnings and notes mostly
correspond to errors, warnings and style-warnings, but many things
that the cleanup considers to be style-warnings are printed as
warnings rather than notes.  Also, warnings, style-warnings and most
errors aren't really signaled using the condition system.


\subsection{Errors During Macroexpansion}
\cpsubindex{macroexpansion}{errors during}

The compiler handles errors that happen during macroexpansion, turning
them into compiler errors.  If you want to debug the error (to debug a
macro), you can set \code{*break-on-signals*} to \code{error}.  For
example, this definition:

\begin{lisp}
(defun foo (e l)
  (do ((current l (cdr current))
       ((atom current) nil))
      (when (eq (car current) e) (return current))))
\end{lisp}

gives this error:

\begin{example}
In: DEFUN FOO
  (DO ((CURRENT L #) (# NIL)) (WHEN (EQ # E) (RETURN CURRENT)) )
Error: (during macroexpansion)

Error in function LISP::DO-DO-BODY.
DO step variable is not a symbol: (ATOM CURRENT)
\end{example}


\subsection{Read Errors}
\cpsubindex{read errors}{compiler}

The compiler also handles errors while reading the source.  For example:

\begin{example}
Error: Read error at 2:
 "(,/\back{foo})"
Error in function LISP::COMMA-MACRO.
Comma not inside a backquote.
\end{example}

The ``\code{at 2}'' refers to the character position in the source file at
which the error was signaled, which is generally immediately after the
erroneous text.  The next line, ``\code{(,/\back{foo})}'', is the line in
the source that contains the error file position.  The ``\code{/\back{} }''
indicates the error position within that line (in this example,
immediately after the offending comma.)

When in \hemlock{} (or any other EMACS-like editor), you can go to a
character position with:

\begin{example}
M-< C-u \var{position} C-f
\end{example}

Note that if the source is from a \hemlock{} buffer, then the position
is relative to the start of the compiled region or \code{defun}, not the
file or buffer start.

After printing a read error message, the compiler attempts to recover from the
error by backing up to the start of the enclosing top-level form and reading
again with \code{*read-suppress*} true.  If the compiler can recover from the
error, then it substitutes a call to \code{cerror} for the unreadable form and
proceeds to compile the rest of the file normally.

If there is a read error when the file position is at the end of the file
(i.e., an unexpected EOF error), then the error message looks like this:

\begin{example}
Error: Read error in form starting at 14:
 "(defun test ()"
Error in function LISP::FLUSH-WHITESPACE.
EOF while reading #<Stream for file "/usr/me/test.lisp">
\end{example}

In this case, ``\code{starting at 14}'' indicates the character
position at which the compiler started reading, i.e. the position
before the start of the form that was missing the closing delimiter.
The line \w{"\code{(defun test ()}"} is first line after the starting
position that the compiler thinks might contain the unmatched open
delimiter.


\subsection{Error Message Parameterization}
\cpsubindex{error messages}{verbosity}
\cpsubindex{verbosity}{of error messages}

There is some control over the verbosity of error messages.  See also
\varref{undefined-warning-limit}, \code{*efficiency-note-limit*} and
\varref{efficiency-note-cost-threshold}.

\begin{defvar}{}{enclosing-source-cutoff} 
  
  This variable specifies the number of enclosing actual source forms
  that are printed in full, rather than in the abbreviated processing
  path format.  Increasing the value from its default of \code{1}
  allows you to see more of the guts of the macroexpanded source,
  which is useful when debugging macros.
\end{defvar}

\begin{defvar}{}{error-print-length}
  \defvarx{error-print-level}
  
  These variables are the print level and print length used in
  printing error messages.  The default values are \code{5} and
  \code{3}.  If null, the global values of \code{*print-level*} and
  \code{*print-length*} are used.
\end{defvar}

\begin{defmac}{extensions:}{def-source-context}{%
    \args{\var{name} \var{lambda-list} \mstar{form}}}
  
  This macro defines how to extract an abbreviated source context from
  the \var{name}d form when it appears in the compiler input.
  \var{lambda-list} is a \code{defmacro} style lambda-list used to
  parse the arguments.  The \var{body} should return a list of
  subforms that can be printed on about one line.  There are
  predefined methods for \code{defstruct}, \code{defmethod}, etc.  If
  no method is defined, then the first two subforms are returned.
  Note that this facility implicitly determines the string name
  associated with anonymous functions.
\end{defmac}


\section{Types in Python}
\cpsubindex{types}{in python}

A big difference between \python{} and all other \llisp{} compilers
is the approach to type checking and amount of knowledge about types:
\begin{itemize}
  
\item \python{} treats type declarations much differently that other
  Lisp compilers do.  \python{} doesn't blindly believe type
  declarations; it considers them assertions about the program that
  should be checked.
  
\item \python{} also has a tremendously greater knowledge of the
  \clisp{} type system than other compilers.  Support is incomplete
  only for the \code{not}, \code{and} and \code{satisfies} types.
\end{itemize}
See also sections \ref{advanced-type-stuff} and \ref{type-inference}.


\subsection{Compile Time Type Errors}
\cindex{compile time type errors}
\cpsubindex{type checking}{at compile time}

If the compiler can prove at compile time that some portion of the
program cannot be executed without a type error, then it will give a
warning at compile time.  It is possible that the offending code would
never actually be executed at run-time due to some higher level
consistency constraint unknown to the compiler, so a type warning
doesn't always indicate an incorrect program.  For example, consider
this code fragment:
\begin{lisp}
(defun raz (foo)
  (let ((x (case foo
             (:this 13)
             (:that 9)
             (:the-other 42))))
    (declare (fixnum x))
    (foo x)))
\end{lisp}

Compilation produces this warning:

\begin{example}
In: DEFUN RAZ
  (CASE FOO (:THIS 13) (:THAT 9) (:THE-OTHER 42))
--> LET COND IF COND IF COND IF 
==>
  (COND)
Warning: This is not a FIXNUM:
  NIL
\end{example}

In this case, the warning is telling you that if \code{foo} isn't any
of \kwd{this}, \kwd{that} or \kwd{the-other}, then \code{x} will be
initialized to \false, which the \code{fixnum} declaration makes
illegal.  The warning will go away if \code{ecase} is used instead of
\code{case}, or if \kwd{the-other} is changed to \true.

This sort of spurious type warning happens moderately often in the
expansion of complex macros and in inline functions.  In such cases,
there may be dead code that is impossible to correctly execute.  The
compiler can't always prove this code is dead (could never be
executed), so it compiles the erroneous code (which will always signal
an error if it is executed) and gives a warning.

\begin{defun}{extensions:}{required-argument}{}
  
  This function can be used as the default value for keyword arguments
  that must always be supplied.  Since it is known by the compiler to
  never return, it will avoid any compile-time type warnings that
  would result from a default value inconsistent with the declared
  type.  When this function is called, it signals an error indicating
  that a required keyword argument was not supplied.  This function is
  also useful for \code{defstruct} slot defaults corresponding to
  required arguments.  \xlref{empty-type}.
  
  Although this function is a \cmucl{} extension, it is relatively harmless
  to use it in otherwise portable code, since you can easily define it
  yourself:
  \begin{lisp}
    (defun required-argument ()
      (error "A required keyword argument was not supplied."))
    \end{lisp}
\end{defun}

Type warnings are inhibited when the
\code{extensions:inhibit-warnings} optimization quality is \code{3}
(\pxlref{compiler-policy}.)  This can be used in a local declaration
to inhibit type warnings in a code fragment that has spurious
warnings.


\subsection{Precise Type Checking}
\label{precise-type-checks}
\cindex{precise type checking}
\cpsubindex{type checking}{precise}

With the default compilation policy, all type
assertions\footnote{There are a few circumstances where a type
  declaration is discarded rather than being used as type assertion.
  This doesn't affect safety much, since such discarded declarations
  are also not believed to be true by the compiler.}  are precisely
checked.  Precise checking means that the check is done as though
\code{typep} had been called with the exact type specifier that
appeared in the declaration.  \python{} uses \var{policy} to determine
whether to trust type assertions (\pxlref{compiler-policy}).  Type
assertions from declarations are indistinguishable from the type
assertions on arguments to built-in functions.  In \python, adding
type declarations makes code safer.

If a variable is declared to be \w{\code{(integer 3 17)}}, then its
value must always always be an integer between \code{3} and \code{17}.
If multiple type declarations apply to a single variable, then all the
declarations must be correct; it is as though all the types were
intersected producing a single \code{and} type specifier.

Argument type declarations are automatically enforced.  If you declare
the type of a function argument, a type check will be done when that
function is called.  In a function call, the called function does the
argument type checking, which means that a more restrictive type
assertion in the calling function (e.g., from \code{the}) may be lost.

The types of structure slots are also checked.  The value of a
structure slot must always be of the type indicated in any \kwd{type}
slot option.\footnote{The initial value need not be of this type as
  long as the corresponding argument to the constructor is always
  supplied, but this will cause a compile-time type warning unless
  \code{required-argument} is used.} Because of precise type checking,
the arguments to slot accessors are checked to be the correct type of
structure.

In traditional \llisp{} compilers, not all type assertions are
checked, and type checks are not precise.  Traditional compilers
blindly trust explicit type declarations, but may check the argument
type assertions for built-in functions.  Type checking is not precise,
since the argument type checks will be for the most general type legal
for that argument.  In many systems, type declarations suppress what
little type checking is being done, so adding type declarations makes
code unsafe.  This is a problem since it discourages writing type
declarations during initial coding.  In addition to being more error
prone, adding type declarations during tuning also loses all the
benefits of debugging with checked type assertions.

To gain maximum benefit from \python{}'s type checking, you should
always declare the types of function arguments and structure slots as
precisely as possible.  This often involves the use of \code{or},
\code{member} and other list-style type specifiers.  Paradoxically,
even though adding type declarations introduces type checks, it
usually reduces the overall amount of type checking.  This is
especially true for structure slot type declarations.

\python{} uses the \code{safety} optimization quality (rather than
presence or absence of declarations) to choose one of three levels of
run-time type error checking: \pxlref{optimize-declaration}.
\xlref{advanced-type-stuff} for more information about types in
\python{}.


\subsection{Weakened Type Checking}
\label{weakened-type-checks}
\cindex{weakened type checking}
\cpsubindex{type checking}{weakened}

When the value for the \code{speed} optimization quality is greater
than \code{safety}, and \code{safety} is not \code{0}, then type
checking is weakened to reduce the speed and space penalty.  In
structure-intensive code this can double the speed, yet still catch
most type errors.  Weakened type checks provide a level of safety
similar to that of ``safe'' code in other \llisp{} compilers.

A type check is weakened by changing the check to be for some
convenient supertype of the asserted type.  For example,
\code{\w{(integer 3 17)}} is changed to \code{fixnum},
\code{\w{(simple-vector 17)}} to \code{simple-vector}, and structure
types are changed to \code{structure}.  A complex check like:
\begin{example}
(or node hunk (member :foo :bar :baz))
\end{example}
will be omitted entirely (i.e., the check is weakened to \code{*}.)  If
a precise check can be done for no extra cost, then no weakening is
done.

Although weakened type checking is similar to type checking done by
other compilers, it is sometimes safer and sometimes less safe.
Weakened checks are done in the same places is precise checks, so all
the preceding discussion about where checking is done still applies.
Weakened checking is sometimes somewhat unsafe because although the
check is weakened, the precise type is still input into type
inference.  In some contexts this will result in type inferences not
justified by the weakened check, and hence deletion of some type
checks that would be done by conventional compilers.

For example, if this code was compiled with weakened checks:

\begin{lisp}
(defstruct foo
  (a nil :type simple-string))

(defstruct bar
  (a nil :type single-float))

(defun myfun (x)
  (declare (type bar x))
  (* (bar-a x) 3.0))
\end{lisp}

and \code{myfun} was passed a \code{foo}, then no type error would be
signaled, and we would try to multiply a \code{simple-vector} as
though it were a float (with unpredictable results.)  This is because
the check for \code{bar} was weakened to \code{structure}, yet when
compiling the call to \code{bar-a}, the compiler thinks it knows it
has a \code{bar}.

Note that normally even weakened type checks report the precise type
in error messages.  For example, if \code{myfun}'s \code{bar} check is
weakened to \code{structure}, and the argument is \false{}, then the
error will be:

\begin{example}
Type-error in MYFUN:
  NIL is not of type BAR
\end{example}

However, there is some speed and space cost for signaling a precise
error, so the weakened type is reported if the \code{speed}
optimization quality is \code{3} or \code{debug} quality is less than
\code{1}:

\begin{example}
Type-error in MYFUN:
  NIL is not of type STRUCTURE
\end{example}

\xlref{optimize-declaration} for further discussion of the
\code{optimize} declaration.


\section{Getting Existing Programs to Run}
\cpsubindex{existing programs}{to run}
\cpsubindex{types}{portability}
\cindex{compatibility with other Lisps}

Since \python{} does much more comprehensive type checking than other
Lisp compilers, \python{} will detect type errors in many programs
that have been debugged using other compilers.  These errors are
mostly incorrect declarations, although compile-time type errors can
find actual bugs if parts of the program have never been tested.

Some incorrect declarations can only be detected by run-time type
checking.  It is very important to initially compile programs with
full type checks and then test this version.  After the checking
version has been tested, then you can consider weakening or
eliminating type checks.  {\bf This applies even to previously debugged
  programs.}  \python{} does much more type inference than other
\llisp{} compilers, so believing an incorrect declaration does much
more damage.

The most common problem is with variables whose initial value doesn't
match the type declaration.  Incorrect initial values will always be
flagged by a compile-time type error, and they are simple to fix once
located.  Consider this code fragment:

\begin{example}
(prog (foo)
  (declare (fixnum foo))
  (setq foo ...)
  ...)
\end{example}

Here the variable \code{foo} is given an initial value of \false, but
is declared to be a \code{fixnum}.  Even if it is never read, the
initial value of a variable must match the declared type.  There are
two ways to fix this problem.  Change the declaration:

\begin{example}
(prog (foo)
  (declare (type (or fixnum null) foo))
  (setq foo ...)
  ...)
\end{example}

or change the initial value:

\begin{example}
(prog ((foo 0))
  (declare (fixnum foo))
  (setq foo ...)
  ...)
\end{example}

It is generally preferable to change to a legal initial value rather
than to weaken the declaration, but sometimes it is simpler to weaken
the declaration than to try to make an initial value of the
appropriate type.

Another declaration problem occasionally encountered is incorrect
declarations on \code{defmacro} arguments.  This probably usually
happens when a function is converted into a macro.  Consider this
macro:

\begin{lisp}
(defmacro my-1+ (x)
  (declare (fixnum x))
  `(the fixnum (1+ ,x)))
\end{lisp}

Although legal and well-defined \clisp, this meaning of this
definition is almost certainly not what the writer intended.  For
example, this call is illegal:

\begin{lisp}
(my-1+ (+ 4 5))
\end{lisp}

The call is illegal because the argument to the macro is \w{\code{(+ 4
    5)}}, which is a \code{list}, not a \code{fixnum}.  Because of
macro semantics, it is hardly ever useful to declare the types of
macro arguments.  If you really want to assert something about the
type of the result of evaluating a macro argument, then put a
\code{the} in the expansion:

\begin{lisp}
(defmacro my-1+ (x)
  `(the fixnum (1+ (the fixnum ,x))))
\end{lisp}

In this case, it would be stylistically preferable to change this
macro back to a function and declare it inline.  Macros have no
efficiency advantage over inline functions when using \python{}.
\xlref{inline-expansion}.


Some more subtle problems are caused by incorrect declarations that
can't be detected at compile time.  Consider this code:

\begin{example}
(do ((pos 0 (position #\back{a} string :start (1+ pos))))
    ((null pos))
  (declare (fixnum pos))
  ...)
\end{example}

Although \code{pos} is almost always a \code{fixnum}, it is \false{}
at the end of the loop.  If this example is compiled with full type
checks (the default), then running it will signal a type error at the
end of the loop.  If compiled without type checks, the program will go
into an infinite loop (or perhaps \code{position} will complain
because \w{\code{(1+ nil)}} isn't a sensible start.)  Why?  Because if
you compile without type checks, the compiler just quietly believes
the type declaration.  Since \code{pos} is always a \code{fixnum}, it
is never \nil, so \w{\code{(null pos)}} is never true, and the loop
exit test is optimized away.  Such errors are sometimes flagged by
unreachable code notes (\pxlref{dead-code-notes}), but it is still
important to initially compile any system with full type checks, even
if the system works fine when compiled using other compilers.

In this case, the fix is to weaken the type declaration to
\w{\code{(or fixnum null)}}.\footnote{Actually, this declaration is
  totally unnecessary in \python{}, since it already knows
  \code{position} returns a non-negative \code{fixnum} or \false.}
Note that there is usually little performance penalty for weakening a
declaration in this way.  Any numeric operations in the body can still
assume the variable is a \code{fixnum}, since \false{} is not a legal
numeric argument.  Another possible fix would be to say:

\begin{example}
(do ((pos 0 (position #\back{a} string :start (1+ pos))))
    ((null pos))
  (let ((pos pos))
    (declare (fixnum pos))
    ...))
\end{example}

This would be preferable in some circumstances, since it would allow a
non-standard representation to be used for the local \code{pos}
variable in the loop body (see section \ref{ND-variables}.)

In summary, remember that {\em all} values that a variable {\em ever}
has must be of the declared type, and that you should test using safe
code initially.


\section{Compiler Policy}
\label{compiler-policy}
\cpsubindex{policy}{compiler}
\cindex{compiler policy}

The policy is what tells the compiler \var{how} to compile a program.
This is logically (and often textually) distinct from the program
itself.  Broad control of policy is provided by the \code{optimize}
declaration; other declarations and variables control more specific
aspects of compilation.


\subsection{The Optimize Declaration}
\label{optimize-declaration}
\cindex{optimize declaration}
\cpsubindex{declarations}{\code{optimize}}

The \code{optimize} declaration recognizes six different
\var{qualities}.  The qualities are conceptually independent aspects
of program performance.  In reality, increasing one quality tends to
have adverse effects on other qualities.  The compiler compares the
relative values of qualities when it needs to make a trade-off; i.e.,
if \code{speed} is greater than \code{safety}, then improve speed at
the cost of safety.

The default for all qualities (except \code{debug}) is \code{1}.
Whenever qualities are equal, ties are broken according to a broad
idea of what a good default environment is supposed to be.  Generally
this downplays \code{speed}, \code{compile-speed} and \code{space} in
favor of \code{safety} and \code{debug}.  Novice and casual users
should stick to the default policy.  Advanced users often want to
improve speed and memory usage at the cost of safety and
debuggability.

If the value for a quality is \code{0} or \code{3}, then it may have a
special interpretation.  A value of \code{0} means ``totally
unimportant'', and a \code{3} means ``ultimately important.''  These
extreme optimization values enable ``heroic'' compilation strategies
that are not always desirable and sometimes self-defeating.
Specifying more than one quality as \code{3} is not desirable, since
it doesn't tell the compiler which quality is most important.


These are the optimization qualities:
\begin{Lentry}
  
\item[\code{speed}] \cindex{speed optimization quality}How fast the
  program should is run.  \code{speed 3} enables some optimizations
  that hurt debuggability.
  
\item[\code{compilation-speed}] \cindex{compilation-speed optimization
    quality}How fast the compiler should run.  Note that increasing
  this above \code{safety} weakens type checking.
  
\item[\code{space}] \cindex{space optimization quality}How much space
  the compiled code should take up.  Inline expansion is mostly
  inhibited when \code{space} is greater than \code{speed}.  A value
  of \code{0} enables promiscuous inline expansion.  Wide use of a
  \code{0} value is not recommended, as it may waste so much space
  that run time is slowed.  \xlref{inline-expansion} for a discussion
  of inline expansion.
  
\item[\code{debug}] \cindex{debug optimization quality}How debuggable
  the program should be.  The quality is treated differently from the
  other qualities: each value indicates a particular level of debugger
  information; it is not compared with the other qualities.
  \xlref{debugger-policy} for more details.
  
\item[\code{safety}] \cindex{safety optimization quality}How much
  error checking should be done.  If \code{speed}, \code{space} or
  \code{compilation-speed} is more important than \code{safety}, then
  type checking is weakened (\pxlref{weakened-type-checks}).  If
  \code{safety} if \code{0}, then no run time error checking is done.
  In addition to suppressing type checks, \code{0} also suppresses
  argument count checking, unbound-symbol checking and array bounds
  checks.
  
\item[\code{extensions:inhibit-warnings}] \cindex{inhibit-warnings
    optimization quality}This is a \cmucl{} extension that determines how
  little (or how much) diagnostic output should be printed during
  compilation.  This quality is compared to other qualities to
  determine whether to print style notes and warnings concerning those
  qualities.  If \code{speed} is greater than \code{inhibit-warnings},
  then notes about how to improve speed will be printed, etc.  The
  default value is \code{1}, so raising the value for any standard
  quality above its default enables notes for that quality.  If
  \code{inhibit-warnings} is \code{3}, then all notes and most
  non-serious warnings are inhibited.  This is useful with
  \code{declare} to suppress warnings about unavoidable problems.
\end{Lentry}


\subsection{The Optimize-Interface Declaration}
\label{optimize-interface-declaration}
\cindex{optimize-interface declaration}
\cpsubindex{declarations}{\code{optimize-interface}}

The \code{extensions:optimize-interface} declaration is identical in
syntax to the \code{optimize} declaration, but it specifies the policy
used during compilation of code the compiler automatically generates
to check the number and type of arguments supplied to a function.  It
is useful to specify this policy separately, since even thoroughly
debugged functions are vulnerable to being passed the wrong arguments.
The \code{optimize-interface} declaration can specify that arguments
should be checked even when the general \code{optimize} policy is
unsafe.

Note that this argument checking is the checking of user-supplied
arguments to any functions defined within the scope of the
declaration, \code{not} the checking of arguments to \llisp{}
primitives that appear in those definitions.

The idea behind this declaration is that it allows the definition of
functions that appear fully safe to other callers, but that do no
internal error checking.  Of course, it is possible that arguments may
be invalid in ways other than having incorrect type.  Functions
compiled unsafely must still protect themselves against things like
user-supplied array indices that are out of bounds and improper lists.
See also the \kwd{context-declarations} option to
\macref{with-compilation-unit}.


\section{Open Coding and Inline Expansion}
\label{open-coding}
\cindex{open-coding}
\cindex{inline expansion}
\cindex{static functions}

Since \clisp{} forbids the redefinition of standard functions\footnote{See the
proposed X3J13 ``lisp-symbol-redefinition'' cleanup.}, the compiler can have
special knowledge of these standard functions embedded in it.  This special
knowledge is used in various ways (open coding, inline expansion, source
transformation), but the implications to the user are basically the same:
\begin{itemize}
  
\item Attempts to redefine standard functions may be frustrated, since
  the function may never be called.  Although it is technically
  illegal to redefine standard functions, users sometimes want to
  implicitly redefine these functions when they are debugging using
  the \code{trace} macro.  Special-casing of standard functions can be
  inhibited using the \code{notinline} declaration.
  
\item The compiler can have multiple alternate implementations of
  standard functions that implement different trade-offs of speed,
  space and safety.  This selection is based on the compiler policy,
  \pxlref{compiler-policy}.
\end{itemize}


When a function call is {\em open coded}, inline code whose effect is
equivalent to the function call is substituted for that function call.
When a function call is {\em closed coded}, it is usually left as is,
although it might be turned into a call to a different function with
different arguments.  As an example, if \code{nthcdr} were to be open
coded, then

\begin{lisp}
(nthcdr 4 foobar)
\end{lisp}

might turn into

\begin{lisp}
(cdr (cdr (cdr (cdr foobar))))
\end{lisp}

or even 

\begin{lisp}
(do ((i 0 (1+ i))
     (list foobar (cdr foobar)))
    ((= i 4) list))
\end{lisp}

If \code{nth} is closed coded, then

\begin{lisp}
(nth x l)
\end{lisp}

might stay the same, or turn into something like:

\begin{lisp}
(car (nthcdr x l))
\end{lisp}

In general, open coding sacrifices space for speed, but some functions (such as
\code{car}) are so simple that they are always open-coded.  Even when not
open-coded, a call to a standard function may be transformed into a
different function call (as in the last example) or compiled as {\em
static call}. Static function call uses a more efficient calling
convention that forbids redefinition.
