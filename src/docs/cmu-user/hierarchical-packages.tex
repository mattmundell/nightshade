\subsection{Introduction}

The \clisp{} package system, designed and standardized several years
ago, is not hierarchical. Since \clisp{} was standardized, other
languages, including Java and Perl, have evolved namespaces which are
hierarchical. This document describes a hierarchical package naming
scheme for \clisp{}. The scheme was proposed by Franz Inc and
implemented in their \textit{Allegro Common Lisp} product; a
compatible implementation of the naming scheme is implemented in
\cmucl{}. This documentation is based on the Franz Inc. documentation,
and is included with permission.

The goals of hierarchical packages in \clisp{} are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Reduce collisions with user-defined packages: it is a well-known
problem that package names used by the Lisp implementation and those
defined by users can easily conflict. The intent of hierarchical
packages is to reduce such conflicts to a minimum.

\item
Improve modularity: the current organization of packages in various
implementations has grown over the years and appears somewhat random.
Organizing future packages into a hierarchy will help make the
intention of the implementation more clear.

\item 
Foster growth in \clisp{} programs, or modules, available to the CL
community: the Perl and Java communities are able to contribute code
to repositories, with minimal fear of collision, because of the
hierarchical nature of the name spaces used by the contributed code.
We want the Lisp community to benefit from shared modules in the same
way.
\end{itemize}

In a nutshell, a dot (\verb|.|) is used to separate levels in package
names, and a leading dot signifies a relative package name. The choice
of dot follows Java. Perl, another language with hierarchical
packages, uses a colon (\verb|:|) as a delimiter, but the colon is
already reserved in \clisp{}. Absolute package names require no
modifications to the underlying \clisp{} implementation. Relative
package names require only small and simple modifications.


\subsection{Relative package names}

Relative package names are needed for the same reason as relative
pathnames, for brevity and to reduce the brittleness of absolute
names. A relative package name is one that begins with one or more
dots. A single dot means the current package, two dots mean the parent
of the current package, and so on.

Table~\ref{tbl:hierarchical-packages} presents a number of examples,
assuming that packages named \verb|foo|, \verb|foo.bar|,
\verb|mypack|, \verb|mypack.foo|, \verb|mypack.foo.bar|,
\verb|mypack.foo.baz|, \verb|mypack.bar|, and \verb|mypack.bar.baz|,
have all been created.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
relative name   &  current package & absolute name of referenced package \\
\hline
foo &               any  &                      foo \\
foo.bar &           any &                       foo.bar \\
.foo &              mypack &                    mypack.foo \\
 .foo.bar &         mypack &                    mypack.foo.bar \\
 ..foo &            mypack.bar &                mypack.foo \\
 ..foo.baz &        mypack.bar &                mypack.foo.baz \\
 ...foo &           mypack.bar.baz &            mypack.foo \\
 . &                mypack.bar.baz &            mypack.bar.baz \\
 .. &               mypack.bar.baz &            mypack.bar \\
 ... &              mypack.bar.baz &            mypack \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\end{table}

Additional notes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
All packages in the hierarchy must exist.

\item
\textbf{Warning about nicknames}: Unless you provide nicknames for
your hierarchical packages (and we recommend against doing so because
the number gets quite large), you can only use the names supplied. You
cannot mix in nicknames or alternate names. \code{cl-user} (and
\code{user}) are nicknames of the \code{common-lisp-user} package.
Consider the following:

\begin{verbatim}
   (defpackage :cl-user.foo)
\end{verbatim}
  
When the current package (the value of the variable \code{*package*})
is \code{common-lisp-user}, you might expect \verb|.foo| to refer to
\verb|cl-user.foo|, but it does not. It refers to the non-existent
package \verb|common-lisp-user.foo|. Note that the purpose of
nicknames is to provide shorter names in place of the longer names
that are designed to be fully descriptive. The hope is that
hierarchical packages makes longer names unnecessary and thus makes
nicknames unnecessary.

\item
Multiple dots can only appear at the beginning of a package name. For
example, \verb|foo.bar..baz| does not mean \verb|foo.baz| -- it is
invalid. (Of course, it is perfectly legal to name a package
\verb|foo.bar..baz|, but \code{cl:find-package} will not process such
a name to find \verb|foo.baz| in the package hierarchy.)
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Compatibility with ANSI \clisp{}}

The implementation of hierarchical packages modifies the
\code{cl:find-package} function, and provides certain auxiliary
functions, \code{package-parent}, \code{package-children}, and
\code{relative-package-name-to-package}, as described in this section.
The function \code{defpackage} itself requires no modification.

While the changes to \code{cl:find-package} are small and described
below, it is an important consideration for authors who would like
their programs to run on a variety of implementations that using
hierarchical packages will work in an implementation without the
modifications discussed in this document. We show why after
describing the changes to \code{cl:find-package}.

Absolute hierarchical package names require no changes in the
underlying \clisp{} implementation.


\subsubsection{Changes to \code{cl:find-package}}

Using relative hierarchical package names requires a simple
modification of \code{cl:find-package}.

In ANSI \clisp{}, \code{cl:find-package}, if passed a package object,
returns it; if passed a string, \code{cl:find-package} looks for a
package with that string as its name or nickname, and returns the
package if it finds one, or returns nil if it does not; if passed a
symbol, the symbol name (a string) is extracted and
\code{cl:find-package} proceeds as it does with a string.

For implementing hierarchical packages, the behavior when the argument
is a package object (return it) does not change. But when the argument
is a string starting with one or more dots not directly naming a
package, \code{cl:find-package} will, instead of returning nil, check
whether the string can be resolved as naming a relative package, and
if so, return the associated absolute package object. (If the argument
is a symbol, the symbol name is extracted and \code{cl:find-package}
proceeds as it does with a string argument.)

Note that you should not use leading dots in package names when using
hierarchical packages.

\subsubsection{Using hierarchical packages without modifying cl:find-package}

Even without the modifications to \code{cl:find-package}, authors need
not avoid using relative package names, but the ability to reuse
relative package names is restricted. Consider for example a module
\textit{foo} which is composed of the \verb|my.foo.bar| and
\verb|my.foo.baz| packages. In the code for each of the these packages
there are relative package references, \verb|..bar| and \verb|..baz|.

Implementations that have the new \code{cl:find-package} would carry
the keyword \verb|:relative-package-names| on their \code{*features*}
list (this is the case of \cmucl{} releases starting from 18d). Then,
in the \textit{foo} module, there would be definitions of the
\verb|my.foo.bar| and \verb|my.foo.baz| packages like so:

\begin{verbatim}
   (defpackage :my.foo.bar
     #-relative-package-names (:nicknames #:..bar)
     ...)

   (defpackage :my.foo.baz
     #-relative-package-names (:nicknames #:..baz)
     ...)
\end{verbatim}

Then, in a \verb|#-relative-package-names| implementation, the symbol
\verb|my.foo.bar:blam| would be visible from \verb|my.foo.baz| as
\verb|..bar:blam|, just as it would from a
\verb|#+relative-package-names| implementation.

So, even without the implementation of the augmented
\code{cl:find-package}, one can still write \clisp{} code that will
work in both types of implementations, but \verb|..bar| and
\verb|..baz| are now used, so you cannot also have
\verb|otherpack.foo.bar| and \verb|otherpack.foo.baz| and use
\verb|..bar| and \verb|..baz| as relative names. (The point of
hierarchical packages, of course, is to allow reusing relative package
names.)
