\cmucl{} offers a facility for interprocess communication (IPC)
on top of using Unix system calls and the complications of that level
of IPC.  There is a simple remote-procedure-call (RPC) package build
on top of TCP/IP sockets.


\section{The REMOTE Package}

The \code{remote} package provides simple RPC facility including
interfaces for creating servers, connecting to already existing
servers, and calling functions in other Lisp processes.  The routines
for establishing a connection between two processes,
\code{create-request-server} and \code{connect-to-remote-server},
return \var{wire} structures.  A wire maintains the current state of
a connection, and all the RPC forms require a wire to indicate where
to send requests.


\subsection{Connecting Servers and Clients}

Before a client can connect to a server, it must know the network address on
which the server accepts connections.  Network addresses consist of a host
address or name, and a port number.  Host addresses are either a string of the
form \code{VANCOUVER.SLISP.CS.CMU.EDU} or a 32 bit unsigned integer.  Port
numbers are 16 bit unsigned integers.  Note: \var{port} in this context has
nothing to do with Mach ports and message passing.

When a process wants to receive connection requests (that is, become a
server), it first picks an integer to use as the port.  Only one server
(Lisp or otherwise) can use a given port number on a given machine at
any particular time.  This can be an iterative process to find a free
port: picking an integer and calling \code{create-request-server}.  This
function signals an error if the chosen port is unusable.  You will
probably want to write a loop using \code{handler-case}, catching
conditions of type error, since this function does not signal more
specific conditions.

\begin{defun}{wire:}{create-request-server}{%
    \args{\var{port} \ampoptional{} \var{on-connect}}}

  \code{create-request-server} sets up the current Lisp to accept
  connections on the given port.  If port is unavailable for any
  reason, this signals an error.  When a client connects to this port,
  the acceptance mechanism makes a wire structure and invokes the
  \var{on-connect} function.  Invoking this function has a couple
  purposes, and \var{on-connect} may be \nil{} in which case the
  system foregoes invoking any function at connect time.
  
  The \var{on-connect} function is both a hook that allows you access
  to the wire created by the acceptance mechanism, and it confirms the
  connection.  This function takes two arguments, the wire and the
  host address of the connecting process.  See the section on host
  addresses below.  When \var{on-connect} is \nil, the request server
  allows all connections.  When it is non-\nil, the function returns
  two values, whether to accept the connection and a function the
  system should call when the connection terminates.  Either value may
  be \nil, but when the first value is \nil, the acceptance mechanism
  destroys the wire.
  
  \code{create-request-server} returns an object that
  \code{destroy-request-server} uses to terminate a connection.
\end{defun}

\begin{defun}{wire:}{destroy-request-server}{\args{\var{server}}}
  
  \code{destroy-request-server} takes the result of
  \code{create-request-server} and terminates that server.  Any
  existing connections remain intact, but all additional connection
  attempts will fail.
\end{defun}

\begin{defun}{wire:}{connect-to-remote-server}{%
    \args{\var{host} \var{port} \ampoptional{} \var{on-death}}}
  
  \code{connect-to-remote-server} attempts to connect to a remote
  server at the given \var{port} on \var{host} and returns a wire
  structure if it is successful.  If \var{on-death} is non-\nil, it is
  a function the system invokes when this connection terminates.
\end{defun}


\subsection{Remote Evaluations}

After the server and client have connected, they each have a wire
allowing function evaluation in the other process.  This RPC mechanism
has three flavors: for side-effect only, for a single value, and for
multiple values.

Only a limited number of data types can be sent across wires as
arguments for remote function calls and as return values: integers
inclusively less than 32 bits in length, symbols, lists, and
\var{remote-objects} (\pxlref{remote-objs}).  The system sends symbols
as two strings, the package name and the symbol name, and if the
package doesn't exist remotely, the remote process signals an error.
The system ignores other slots of symbols.  Lists may be any tree of
the above valid data types.  To send other data types you must
represent them in terms of these supported types.  For example, you
could use \code{prin1-to-string} locally, send the string, and use
\code{read-from-string} remotely.

\begin{defmac}{wire:}{remote}{%
    \args{\var{wire} \mstar{call-specs}}}
  
  The \code{remote} macro arranges for the process at the other end of
  \var{wire} to invoke each of the functions in the \var{call-specs}.
  To make sure the system sends the remote evaluation requests over
  the wire, you must call \code{wire-force-output}.
  
  Each of \var{call-specs} looks like a function call textually, but
  it has some odd constraints and semantics.  The function position of
  the form must be the symbolic name of a function.  \code{remote}
  evaluates each of the argument subforms for each of the
  \var{call-specs} locally in the current context, sending these
  values as the arguments for the functions.
  
  Consider the following example:

\begin{verbatim}
(defun write-remote-string (str)
  (declare (simple-string str))
  (wire:remote wire
    (write-string str)))
\end{verbatim}

  The value of \code{str} in the local process is passed over the wire
  with a request to invoke \code{write-string} on the value.  The
  system does not expect to remotely evaluate \code{str} for a value
  in the remote process.
\end{defmac}

\begin{defun}{wire:}{wire-force-output}{\args{\var{wire}}}
  
  \code{wire-force-output} flushes all internal buffers associated
  with \var{wire}, sending the remote requests.  This is necessary
  after a call to \code{remote}.
\end{defun}

\begin{defmac}{wire:}{remote-value}{\args{\var{wire} \var{call-spec}}}
  
  The \code{remote-value} macro is similar to the \code{remote} macro.
  \code{remote-value} only takes one \var{call-spec}, and it returns
  the value returned by the function call in the remote process.  The
  value must be a valid type the system can send over a wire, and
  there is no need to call \code{wire-force-output} in conjunction
  with this interface.
  
  If client unwinds past the call to \code{remote-value}, the server
  continues running, but the system ignores the value the server sends
  back.
  
  If the server unwinds past the remotely requested call, instead of
  returning normally, \code{remote-value} returns two values, \nil{}
  and \true.  Otherwise this returns the result of the remote
  evaluation and \nil.
\end{defmac}

\begin{defmac}{wire:}{remote-value-bind}{%
    \args{\var{wire} (\mstar{variable}) remote-form
      \mstar{local-forms}}}
  
  \code{remote-value-bind} is similar to \code{multiple-value-bind}
  except the values bound come from \var{remote-form}'s evaluation in
  the remote process.  The \var{local-forms} execute in an implicit
  \code{progn}.
  
  If the client unwinds past the call to \code{remote-value-bind}, the
  server continues running, but the system ignores the values the
  server sends back.
  
  If the server unwinds past the remotely requested call, instead of
  returning normally, the \var{local-forms} never execute, and
  \code{remote-value-bind} returns \nil.
\end{defmac}


\subsection{Remote Objects}
\label{remote-objs}

The wire mechanism only directly supports a limited number of data
types for transmission as arguments for remote function calls and as
return values: integers inclusively less than 32 bits in length,
symbols, lists.  Sometimes it is useful to allow remote processes to
refer to local data structures without allowing the remote process
to operate on the data.  We have \var{remote-objects} to support
this without the need to represent the data structure in terms of
the above data types, to send the representation to the remote
process, to decode the representation, to later encode it again, and
to send it back along the wire.

You can convert any Lisp object into a remote-object.  When you send
a remote-object along a wire, the system simply sends a unique token
for it.  In the remote process, the system looks up the token and
returns a remote-object for the token.  When the remote process
needs to refer to the original Lisp object as an argument to a
remote call back or as a return value, it uses the remote-object it
has which the system converts to the unique token, sending that
along the wire to the originating process.  Upon receipt in the
first process, the system converts the token back to the same
(\code{eq}) remote-object.

\begin{defun}{wire:}{make-remote-object}{\args{\var{object}}}
  
  \code{make-remote-object} returns a remote-object that has
  \var{object} as its value.  The remote-object can be passed across
  wires just like the directly supported wire data types.
\end{defun}

\begin{defun}{wire:}{remote-object-p}{\args{\var{object}}}
  
  The function \code{remote-object-p} returns \true{} if \var{object}
  is a remote object and \nil{} otherwise.
\end{defun}

\begin{defun}{wire:}{remote-object-local-p}{\args{\var{remote}}}
  
  The function \code{remote-object-local-p} returns \true{} if
  \var{remote} refers to an object in the local process.  This is can
  only occur if the local process created \var{remote} with
  \code{make-remote-object}.
\end{defun}

\begin{defun}{wire:}{remote-object-eq}{\args{\var{obj1} \var{obj2}}}
  
  The function \code{remote-object-eq} returns \true{} if \var{obj1} and
  \var{obj2} refer to the same (\code{eq}) lisp object, regardless of
  which process created the remote-objects.
\end{defun}

\begin{defun}{wire:}{remote-object-value}{\args{\var{remote}}}
  
  This function returns the original object used to create the given
  remote object.  It is an error if some other process originally
  created the remote-object.
\end{defun}

\begin{defun}{wire:}{forget-remote-translation}{\args{\var{object}}}
  
  This function removes the information and storage necessary to
  translate remote-objects back into \var{object}, so the next
  \code{gc} can reclaim the memory.  You should use this when you no
  longer expect to receive references to \var{object}.  If some remote
  process does send a reference to \var{object},
  \code{remote-object-value} signals an error.
\end{defun}


\subsection{Host Addresses}

The operating system maintains a database of all the valid host
addresses.  You can use this database to convert between host names
and addresses and vice-versa.

\begin{defun}{ext:}{lookup-host-entry}{\args{\var{host}}}
  
  \code{lookup-host-entry} searches the database for the given
  \var{host} and returns a host-entry structure for it.  If it fails
  to find \var{host} in the database, it returns \nil.  \var{Host} is
  either the address (as an integer) or the name (as a string) of the
  desired host.
\end{defun}

\begin{defun}{ext:}{host-entry-name}{\args{\var{host-entry}}}
  \defunx[ext:]{host-entry-aliases}{\args{\var{host-entry}}}
  \defunx[ext:]{host-entry-addr-list}{\args{\var{host-entry}}}
  \defunx[ext:]{host-entry-addr}{\args{\var{host-entry}}}

  \code{host-entry-name}, \code{host-entry-aliases}, and
  \code{host-entry-addr-list} each return the indicated slot from the
  host-entry structure.  \code{host-entry-addr} returns the primary
  (first) address from the list returned by
  \code{host-entry-addr-list}.
\end{defun}


\section{The WIRE Package}

The \code{wire} package provides for sending data along wires.  The
\code{remote} package sits on top of this package.  All data sent
with a given output routine must be read in the remote process with
the complementary fetching routine.  For example, if you send so a
string with \code{wire-output-string}, the remote process must know
to use \code{wire-get-string}.  To avoid rigid data transfers and
complicated code, the interface supports sending
\var{tagged} data.  With tagged data, the system sends a tag
announcing the type of the next data, and the remote system takes
care of fetching the appropriate type.

When using interfaces at the wire level instead of the RPC level,
the remote process must read everything sent by these routines.  If
the remote process leaves any input on the wire, it will later
mistake the data for an RPC request causing unknown lossage.


\subsection{Untagged Data}

When using these routines both ends of the wire know exactly what types are
coming and going and in what order. This data is restricted to the following
types:

\begin{itemize}
\item
8 bit unsigned bytes.

\item
32 bit unsigned bytes.

\item
32 bit integers.

\item
simple-strings less than 65535 in length.
\end{itemize}

\begin{defun}{wire:}{wire-output-byte}{\args{\var{wire} \var{byte}}}
  \defunx[wire:]{wire-get-byte}{\args{\var{wire}}}
  \defunx[wire:]{wire-output-number}{\args{\var{wire} \var{number}}}
  \defunx[wire:]{wire-get-number}{\args{\var{wire} \ampoptional{}
      \var{signed}}}
  \defunx[wire:]{wire-output-string}{\args{\var{wire} \var{string}}}
  \defunx[wire:]{wire-get-string}{\args{\var{wire}}}
  
  These functions either output or input an object of the specified
  data type.  When you use any of these output routines to send data
  across the wire, you must use the corresponding input routine
  interpret the data.
\end{defun}


\subsection{Tagged Data}

When using these routines, the system automatically transmits and interprets
the tags for you, so both ends can figure out what kind of data transfers
occur.  Sending tagged data allows a greater variety of data types: integers
inclusively less than 32 bits in length, symbols, lists, and \var{remote-objects}
(\pxlref{remote-objs}).  The system sends symbols as two strings, the
package name and the symbol name, and if the package doesn't exist remotely,
the remote process signals an error.  The system ignores other slots of
symbols.  Lists may be any tree of the above valid data types.  To send other
data types you must represent them in terms of these supported types.  For
example, you could use \code{prin1-to-string} locally, send the string, and use
\code{read-from-string} remotely.

\begin{defun}{wire:}{wire-output-object}{%
    \args{\var{wire} \var{object} \ampoptional{} \var{cache-it}}}
  \defunx[wire:]{wire-get-object}{\args{\var{wire}}}
  
  The function \code{wire-output-object} sends \var{object} over
  \var{wire} preceded by a tag indicating its type.
  
  If \var{cache-it} is non-\nil, this function only sends \var{object}
  the first time it gets \var{object}.  Each end of the wire
  associates a token with \var{object}, similar to remote-objects,
  allowing you to send the object more efficiently on successive
  transmissions.  \var{cache-it} defaults to \true{} for symbols and
  \nil{} for other types.  Since the RPC level requires function
  names, a high-level protocol based on a set of function calls saves
  time in sending the functions' names repeatedly.
  
  The function \code{wire-get-object} reads the results of
  \code{wire-output-object} and returns that object.
\end{defun}


\subsection{Making Your Own Wires}

You can create wires manually in addition to the \code{remote}
package's interface creating them for you. To create a wire, you need
a Unix {\em file descriptor}. If you are unfamiliar with Unix file
descriptors, see section 2 of the Unix manual pages.

\begin{defun}{wire:}{make-wire}{\args{\var{descriptor}}}

  The function \code{make-wire} creates a new wire when supplied with
  the file descriptor to use for the underlying I/O operations.
\end{defun}

\begin{defun}{wire:}{wire-p}{\args{\var{object}}}
  
  This function returns \true{} if \var{object} is indeed a wire,
  \nil{} otherwise.
\end{defun}

\begin{defun}{wire:}{wire-fd}{\args{\var{wire}}}
  
  This function returns the file descriptor used by the \var{wire}.
\end{defun}


\section{Out-Of-Band Data}

The TCP/IP protocol allows users to send data asynchronously, otherwise
known as \var{out-of-band} data.  When using this feature, the operating
system interrupts the receiving process if this process has chosen to be
notified about out-of-band data.  The receiver can grab this input
without affecting any information currently queued on the socket.
Therefore, you can use this without interfering with any current
activity due to other wire and remote interfaces.

Unfortunately, most implementations of TCP/IP are broken, so use of
out-of-band data is limited for safety reasons.  You can only reliably
send one character at a time.

This routines in this section provide a mechanism for establishing
handlers for out-of-band characters and for sending them out-of-band.
These all take a Unix file descriptor instead of a wire, but you can
fetch a wire's file descriptor with \code{wire-fd}.

\begin{defun}{wire:}{add-oob-handler}{\args{\var{fd} \var{char} \var{handler}}}
  
  The function \code{add-oob-handler} arranges for \var{handler} to be
  called whenever \var{char} shows up as out-of-band data on the file
  descriptor \var{fd}.
\end{defun}

\begin{defun}{wire:}{remove-oob-handler}{\args{\var{fd} \var{char}}}
  
  This function removes the handler for the character \var{char} on
  the file descriptor \var{fd}.
\end{defun}

\begin{defun}{wire:}{remove-all-oob-handlers}{\args{\var{fd}}}
  
  This function removes all handlers for the file descriptor \var{fd}.
\end{defun}

\begin{defun}{wire:}{send-character-out-of-band}{\args{\var{fd} \var{char}}}
  
  This function Sends the character \var{char} down the file
  descriptor \var{fd} out-of-band.
\end{defun}
