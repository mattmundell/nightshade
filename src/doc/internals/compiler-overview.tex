\chapter{Compiler Overview} % -*- Dictionary: design -*-

The structure of the compiler may be broadly characterized by describing the
compilation phases and the data structures that they manipulate.  The steps in
the compilation are called phases rather than passes since they don't
necessarily involve a full pass over the code.  The data structure used to
represent the code at some point is called an {\it intermediate
representation.}

Two major intermediate representations are used in the compiler:
\begin{itemize}

\item The Implicit Continuation Representation (ICR) represents the lisp-level
semantics of the source code during the initial phases.  Partial evaluation and
semantic analysis are done on this representation.  ICR is roughly equivalent
to a subset of Common Lisp, but is represented as a flow-graph rather than a
syntax tree.  Phases which only manipulate ICR comprise the "front end".  It
would be possible to use a different back end such as one that directly
generated code for a stack machine.

\item The Virtual Machine Representation (VMR) represents the implementation of
the source code on a virtual machine.  The virtual machine may vary depending
on the the target hardware, but VMR is sufficiently stylized that most of the
phases which manipulate it are portable.
\end{itemize}

Each phase is briefly described here.  The phases from ``local call analysis''
to ``constraint propagation'' all interact; for maximum optimization, they
are generally repeated until nothing new is discovered.  The source files which
primarily contain each phase are listed after ``Files: ''.
\begin{description}

\item[ICR conversion]
Convert the source into ICR, doing macroexpansion and simple source-to-source
transformation.  All names are resolved at this time, so we don't have to worry
about name conflicts later on.  Files: {\tt ir1tran, srctran, typetran}

\item[Local call analysis] Find calls to local functions and convert them to
local calls to the correct entry point, doing keyword parsing, etc.  Recognize
once-called functions as lets.  Create {\it external entry points} for
entry-point functions.  Files: {\tt locall}

\item[Find components]
Find flow graph components and compute depth-first ordering.  Separate
top-level code from run-time code, and determine which components are top-level
components.  Files: {\tt dfo}

\item[ICR optimize] A grab-bag of all the non-flow ICR optimizations.  Fold
constant functions, propagate types and eliminate code that computes unused
values.  Special-case calls to some known global functions by replacing them
with a computed function.  Merge blocks and eliminate IF-IFs.  Substitute let
variables.  Files: {\tt ir1opt, ir1tran, typetran, seqtran, vm/vm-tran}

\item[Type constraint propagation]
Use global flow analysis to propagate information about lexical variable
types.   Eliminate unnecessary type checks and tests.  Files: {\tt constraint}

\item[Type check generation]
Emit explicit ICR code for any necessary type checks that are too complex to be
easily generated on the fly by the back end.  Files: {\tt checkgen}

\item[Event driven operations]
Various parts of ICR are incrementally recomputed, either eagerly on
modification of the ICR, or lazily, when the relevant information is needed.
\begin{itemize}
\item Check that type assertions are satisfied, marking places where type
checks need to be done.

\item Locate let calls.

\item Delete functions and variables with no references
\end{itemize}
Files: {\tt ir1util}, {\tt ir1opt}

\item[ICR finalize]
This phase is run after all components have been compiled.  It scans the
global variable references, looking for references to undefined variables
and incompatible function redefinitions.  Files: {\tt ir1final}, {\tt main}.

\item[Environment analysis]
Determine which distinct environments need to be allocated, and what
context needed to be closed over by each environment.  We detect non-local
exits and set closure variables.  We also emit cleanup code as funny
function calls.  This is the last pure ICR pass.  Files: {\tt envanal}

\item[Global TN allocation (GTN)]
Iterate over all defined functions, determining calling conventions
and assigning TNs to local variables.  Files: {\tt gtn}

\item[Local TN allocation (LTN)]
Use type and policy information to determine which VMR translation to use
for known functions, and then create TNs for expression evaluation
temporaries.  We also accumulate some random information needed by VMR
conversion.  Files: {\tt ltn}

\item[Control analysis]
Linearize the flow graph in a way that minimizes the number of branches.  The
block-level structure of the flow graph is basically frozen at this point.
Files: {\tt control}

\item[Stack analysis]
Maintain stack discipline for unknown-values continuation in the presence
of local exits.  Files: {\tt stack}

\item[Entry analysis]
Collect some back-end information for each externally callable function.

\item[VMR conversion] Convert ICR into VMR by translating nodes into VOPs.
Emit type checks.  Files: {\tt ir2tran, vmdef}

\item[Copy propagation] Use flow analysis to eliminate unnecessary copying of
TN values.  Files: {\tt copyprop}

\item[Representation selection]
Look at all references to each TN to determine which representation has the
lowest cost.  Emit appropriate move and coerce VOPS for that representation.

\item[Lifetime analysis]
Do flow analysis to find the set of TNs whose lifetimes 
overlap with the lifetimes of each TN being packed.  Annotate call VOPs with
the TNs that need to be saved.  Files: {\tt life}

\item[Pack]
Find a legal register allocation, attempting to minimize unnecessary moves.
Files: {\tt pack}

\item[Code generation]
Call the VOP generators to emit assembly code.  Files: {\tt codegen}

\item[Pipeline reorganization] On some machines, move memory references
backward in the code so that they can overlap with computation.  On machines
with delayed branch instructions, locate instructions that can be moved into
delay slots.  Files: {\tt assem-opt}

\item[Assembly]
Resolve branches and convert in to object code and fixup information.
Files: {\tt assembler}

\item[Dumping] Convert the compiled code into an object file or in-core
function.  Files: {\tt debug-dump}, {\tt dump}, {\tt vm/core}

\end{description}

\chapter{The Implicit Continuation Representation}

The set of special forms recognized is exactly that specified in the Common
Lisp manual.  Everything that is described as a macro in CLTL is a macro.

Large amounts of syntactic information are thrown away by the conversion to an
anonymous flow graph representation.  The elimination of names eliminates the
need to represent most environment manipulation special forms.  The explicit
representation of control eliminates the need to represent BLOCK and GO, and
makes flow analysis easy.  The full Common Lisp LAMBDA is implemented with a
simple fixed-arg lambda, which greatly simplifies later code.
      
The elimination of syntactic information eliminates the need for most of the
"beta transformation" optimizations in Rabbit.  There are no progns, no
tagbodys and no returns.  There are no "close parens" which get in the way of
determining which node receives a given value.

In ICR, computation is represented by Nodes.  These are the node types:
\begin{description}
\item[if]  Represents all conditionals.

\item[set] Represents a {\tt setq}.

\item[ref] Represents a constant or variable reference.

\item[combination] Represents a normal function call.

\item[MV-combination] Represents a {\tt multiple-value-call}.  This is used to
implement all multiple value receiving forms except for {\tt
multiple-value-prog1}, which is implicit.

\item[bind]
This represents the allocation and initialization of the variables in
a lambda.

\item[return]
This collects the return value from a lambda and represents the
control transfer on return.

\item[entry] Marks the start of a dynamic extent that can have non-local exits
to it.  Dynamic state can be saved at this point for restoration on re-entry.

\item[exit] Marks a potentially non-local exit.  This node is interposed
between the non-local uses of a continuation and the {\tt dest} so that code to
do a non-local exit can be inserted if necessary.
\end{description}

Some slots are shared between all node types (via defstruct inheritance.)  This
information held in common between all nodes often makes it possible to avoid
special-casing nodes on the basis of type.  This shared information is
primarily concerned with the order of evaluation and destinations and
properties of results.  This control and value flow is indicated in the node
primarily by pointing to continuations.

The {\tt continuation} structure represents information sufficiently related
to the normal notion of a continuation that naming it so seems sensible.
Basically, a continuation represents a place in the code, or alternatively the
destination of an expression result and a transfer of control.  These two
notions are bound together for the same reasons that they are related in the
standard functional continuation interpretation.

A continuation may be deprived of either or both of its value or control
significance.  If the value of a continuation is unused due to evaluation for
effect, then the continuation will have a null {\tt dest}.  If the {\tt next}
node for a continuation is deleted by some optimization, then {\tt next} will
be {\tt :none}.

  [\#\#\# Continuation kinds...]

The {\tt block} structure represents a basic block, in the the normal sense.
Control transfers other than simple sequencing are represented by information
in the block structure.  The continuation for the last node in a block
represents only the destination for the result.

It is very difficult to reconstruct anything resembling the original source
from ICR, so we record the original source form in each node.  The location of
the source form within the input is also recorded, allowing for interfaces such
as "Edit Compiler Warnings".  See section \ref{source-paths}.

Forms such as special-bind and catch need to have cleanup code executed at all
exit points from the form.  We represent this constraint in ICR by annotating
the code syntactically within the form with a Cleanup structure describing what
needs to be cleaned up.  Environment analysis determines the cleanup locations
by watching for a change in the cleanup between two continuations.  We can't
emit cleanup code during ICR conversion, since we don't know which exits will
be local until after ICR optimizations are done.

Special binding is represented by a call to the funny function %Special-Bind.
The first argument is the Global-Var structure for the variable bound and the
second argument is the value to bind it to.

Some subprimitives are implemented using a macro-like mechanism for translating
%PRIMITIVE forms into arbitrary lisp code.  Subprimitives special-cased by VMR
conversion are represented by a call to the funny function %%Primitive.  The
corresponding Template structure is passed as the first argument.

We check global function calls for syntactic legality with respect to any
defined function type function.  If the call is illegal or we are unable to
tell if it is legal due to non-constant keywords, then we give a warning and
mark the function reference as :notinline to force a full call and cause
subsequent phases to ignore the call.  If the call is legal and is to a known
function, then we annotate the Combination node with the Function-Info
structure that contains the compiler information for the function.


\section{Tail sets}
\#|
Probably want to have a GTN-like function result equivalence class mechanism
for ICR type inference.  This would be like the return value propagation being
done by Propagate-From-Calls, but more powerful, less hackish, and known to
terminate.  The ICR equivalence classes could probably be used by GTN, as well.

What we do is have local call analysis eagerly maintain the equivalence classes
of functions that return the same way by annotating functions with a Tail-Info
structure shared between all functions whose value could be the value of this
function.  We don't require that the calls actually be tail-recursive, only
that the call deliver its value to the result continuation.  [\#\#\# Actually
now done by ICR-OPTIMIZE-RETURN, which is currently making ICR optimize
mandatory.]

We can then use the Tail-Set during ICR type inference.  It would have a type
that is the union across all equivalent functions of the types of all the uses
other than in local calls.  This type would be recomputed during optimization
of return nodes.  When the type changes, we would propagate it to all calls to
any of the equivalent functions.  How do we know when and how to recompute the
type for a tail-set?  Recomputation is driven by type propagation on the result
continuation.

This is really special-casing of RETURN nodes.  The return node has the type
which is the union of all the non-call uses of the result.  The tail-set is
found though the lambda.  We can then recompute the overall union by taking the
union of the type per return node, rather than per-use.


How do result type assertions work?  We can't intersect the assertions across
all functions in the equivalence class, since some of the call combinations may
not happen (or even be possible).  We can intersect the assertion of the result
with the derived types for non-call uses.

When we do a tail call, we obviously can't check that the returned value
matches our assertion.  Although in principle, we would like to be able to
check all assertions, to preserve system integrity, we only need to check
assertions that we depend on.  We can afford to lose some assertion information
as long as we entirely lose it, ignoring it for type inference as well as for
type checking.

Things will work out, since the caller will see the tail-info type as the
derived type for the call, and will emit a type check if it needs a stronger
result.

A remaining question is whether we should intersect the assertion with
per-RETURN derived types from the very beginning (i.e. before the type check
pass).  I think the answer is yes.  We delay the type check pass so that we can
get our best guess for the derived type before we decide whether a check is
necessary.  But with the function return type, we aren't committing to doing
any type check when we intersect with the type assertion; the need to type
check is still determined in the type check pass by examination of the result
continuation.

What is the relationship between the per-RETURN types and the types in the
result continuation?  The assertion is exactly the Continuation-Asserted-Type
(note that the asserted type of result continuations will never change after
ICR conversion).  The per-RETURN derived type is different than the
Continuation-Derived-Type, since it is intersected with the asserted type even
before Type Check runs.  Ignoring the Continuation-Derived-Type probably makes
life simpler anyway, since this breaks the potential circularity of the
Tail-Info-Type will affecting the Continuation-Derived-Type, which affects...

When a given return has no non-call uses, we represent this by using
*empty-type*.  This consistent with the interpretation that a return type of
NIL means the function can't return.


\section{Hairy function representation}

Non-fixed-arg functions are represented using Optional-Dispatch.  An
Optional-Dispatch has an entry-point function for each legal number of
optionals, and one for when extra args are present.  Each entry point function
is a simple lambda.  The entry point function for an optional is passed the
arguments which were actually supplied; the entry point function is expected to
default any remaining parameters and evaluate the actual function body.

If no supplied-p arg is present, then we can do this fairly easily by having
each entry point supply its default and call the next entry point, with the
last entry point containing the body.  If there are supplied-p args, then entry
point function is replaced with a function that calls the original entry
function with T's inserted at the position of all the supplied args with
supplied-p parameters.

We want to be a bit clever about how we handle arguments declared special when
doing optional defaulting, or we will emit really gross code for special
optionals.  If we bound the arg specially over the entire entry-point function,
then the entry point function would be caused to be non-tail-recursive.  What
we can do is only bind the variable specially around the evaluation of the
default, and then read the special and store the final value of the special
into a lexical variable which we then pass as the argument.  In the common case
where the default is a constant, we don't have to special-bind at all, since
the computation of the default is not affected by and cannot affect any special
bindings.

Keyword and rest args are both implemented using a LEXPR-like "more args"
convention.  The More-Entry takes two arguments in addition to the fixed and
optional arguments: the argument context and count.  (ARG <context> <n>)
accesses the N'th additional argument.  Keyword args are implemented directly
using this mechanism.  Rest args are created by calling %Listify-Rest-Args with
the context and count.

The More-Entry parses the keyword arguments and passes the values to the main
function as positional arguments.  If a keyword default is not constant, then
we pass a supplied-p parameter into the main entry and let it worry about
defaulting the argument.  Since the main entry accepts keywords in parsed form,
we can parse keywords at compile time for calls to known functions.  We keep
around the original parsed lambda-list and related information so that people
can figure out how to call the main entry.


\section{ICR representation of non-local exits}

All exits are initially represented by EXIT nodes:
How about an Exit node:
    (defstruct (exit (:include node))
      value)
The Exit node uses the continuation that is to receive the thrown Value.
During optimization, if we discover that the Cont's home-lambda is the same is
the exit node's, then we can delete the Exit node, substituting the Cont for
all of the Value's uses.

The successor block of an EXIT is the entry block in the entered environment.
So we use the Exit node to mark the place where exit code is inserted.  During
environment analysis, we need only insert a single block containing the entry
point stub.

We ensure that all Exits that aren't for a NLX don't have any Value, so that
local exits never require any value massaging.

The Entry node marks the beginning of a block or tagbody:
    (defstruct (entry (:include node))
      (continuations nil :type list)) 

It contains a list of all the continuations that the body could exit to.  The
Entry node is used as a marker for the the place to snapshot state, including
the control stack pointer.  Each lambda has a list of its Entries so
that environment analysis can figure out which continuations are really being
closed over.  There is no reason for optimization to delete Entry nodes,
since they are harmless in the degenerate case: we just emit no code (like a
no-var let).


We represent CATCH using the lexical exit mechanism.  We do a transformation
like this:
   (catch 'foo xxx)  ==>
   (block \#:foo
     (%catch \#'(lambda () (return-from \#:foo (%unknown-values))) 'foo)
     (%within-cleanup :catch
       xxx))

%CATCH just sets up the catch frame which points to the exit function.  %Catch
is an ordinary function as far as ICR is concerned.  The fact that the catcher
needs to be cleaned up is expressed by the Cleanup slots in the continuations
in the body.  %UNKNOWN-VALUES is a dummy function call which represents the
fact that we don't know what values will be thrown.  

%WITHIN-CLEANUP is a special special form that instantiates its first argument
as the current cleanup when converting the body.  In reality, the lambda is
also created by the special special form %ESCAPE-FUNCTION, which gives the
lambda a special :ESCAPE kind so that the back end knows not to generate any
code for it.


We use a similar hack in Unwind-Protect to represent the fact that the cleanup
forms can be invoked at arbitrarily random times.
    (unwind-protect p c)  ==>
    (flet ((\#:cleanup () c))
      (block \#:return
	(multiple-value-bind
	    (\#:next \#:start \#:count)
	    (block \#:unwind
	      (%unwind-protect \#'(lambda (x) (return-from \#:unwind x)))
	      (%within-cleanup :unwind-protect
		(return-from \#:return p)))
	  (\#:cleanup)
	  (%continue-unwind \#:next \#:start \#:count))))

We use the block \#:unwind to represent the entry to cleanup code in the case
where we are non-locally unwound.  Calling of the cleanup function in the
drop-through case (or any local exit) is handled by cleanup generation.  We
make the cleanup a function so that cleanup generation can add calls at local
exits from the protected form.  \#:next, \#:start and \#:count are state used in
the case where we are unwound.  They indicate where to go after doing the
cleanup and what values are being thrown.  The cleanup encloses only the
protected form.  As in CATCH, the escape function is specially tagged as
:ESCAPE.  The cleanup function is tagged as :CLEANUP to inhibit let conversion
(since references are added in environment analysis.)

Notice that implementing these forms using closures over continuations
eliminates any need to special-case ICR flow analysis.  Obviously we don't
really want to make heap-closures here.  In reality these functions are
special-cased by the back-end according to their KIND.


\section{Block compilation}

One of the properties of ICR is that supports "block compilation" by allowing
arbitrarily large amounts of code to be converted at once, with actual
compilation of the code being done at will.


In order to preserve the normal semantics we must recognize that proclamations
(possibly implicit) are scoped.  A proclamation is in effect only from the time
of appearance of the proclamation to the time it is contradicted.  The current
global environment at the end of a block is not necessarily the correct global
environment for compilation of all the code within the block.  We solve this
problem by closing over the relevant information in the ICR at the time it is
converted.  For example, each functional variable reference is marked as
inline, notinline or don't care.  Similarly, each node contains a structure
known as a Cookie which contains the appropriate settings of the compiler
policy switches.

We actually convert each form in the file separately, creating a separate
"initial component" for each one.  Later on, these components are merged as
needed.  The main reason for doing this is to cause EVAL-WHEN processing to be
interleaved with reading. 


\section{Entry points}

\#|

Since we need to evaluate potentially arbitrary code in the XEP argument forms
(for type checking), we can't leave the arguments in the wired passing
locations.  Instead, it seems better to give the XEP max-args fixed arguments,
with the passing locations being the true passing locations.  Instead of using
%XEP-ARG, we reference the appropriate variable.

Also, it might be a good idea to do argument count checking and dispatching
with explicit conditional code in the XEP.  This would simplify both the code
that creates the XEP and the VMR conversion of XEPs.  Also, argument count
dispatching would automatically benefit from any cleverness in compilation of
case-like forms (jump tables, etc).  On the downside, this would push some
assumptions about how arg dispatching is done into ICR.  But then we are
currently violating abstraction at least as badly in VMR conversion, which is
also supposed to be implementation independent.
|\#

As a side-effect of finding which references to known functions can be
converted to local calls, we find any references that cannot be converted.
References that cannot be converted to a local call must evaluate to a
"function object" (or function-entry) that can be called using the full call
convention.  A function that can be called from outside the component is called
an "entry-point".

Lots of stuff that happens at compile-time with local function calls must be
done at run-time when an entry-point is called.

It is desirable for optimization and other purposes if all the calls to every
function were directly present in ICR as local calls.  We cannot directly do
this with entry-point functions, since we don't know where and how the
entry-point will be called until run-time.

What we do is represent all the calls possible from outside the component by
local calls within the component.  For each entry-point function, we create a
corresponding lambda called the external entry point or XEP.  This is a
function which takes the number of arguments passed as the first argument,
followed by arguments corresponding to each required or optional argument.

If an optional argument is unsupplied, the value passed into the XEP is
undefined.  The XEP is responsible for doing argument count checking and
dispatching.  

In the case of a fixed-arg lambda, we emit a call to the %VERIFY-ARGUMENT-COUNT
funny function (conditional on policy), then call the real function on the
passed arguments.  Even in this simple case, we benefit several ways from
having a separate XEP:
 -- The argument count checking is factored out, and only needs to be done in
    full calls.
 -- Argument type checking happens automatically as a consequence of passing
    the XEP arguments in a local call to the real function.  This type checking
    is also only done in full calls.
 -- The real function may use a non-standard calling convention for the benefit
    of recursive or block-compiled calls.  The XEP converts arguments/return
    values to/from the standard convention.  This also requires little
    special-casing of XEPs.

If the function has variable argument count (represented by an
OPTIONAL-DISPATCH), then the XEP contains a COND which dispatches off of the
argument count, calling the appropriate entry-point function (which then does
defaulting).  If there is a more entry (for keyword or rest args), then the XEP
obtains the more arg context and count by calling the %MORE-ARG-CONTEXT funny
function.

All non-local-call references to functions are replaced with references to the
corresponding XEP.  ICR optimization may discover a local call that was
previously a non-local reference.  When we delete the reference to the XEP, we
may find that it has no references.  In this case, we can delete the XEP,
causing the function to no longer be an entry-point.
