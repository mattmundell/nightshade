GC doesn't fix the LIP correctly if it is a raw function address and nobody
else has a handle on the real function object.  (This can happen during
call.)  GC needs to check to see if any of the descriptor objects are a
symbol with the same value as the LIP for the raw-function address.

When GC is trying to find the descriptor object the LIP points into, it
should verify that the LIP points before the end, not just after the start.
