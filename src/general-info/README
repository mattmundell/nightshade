  CMUCL is a free, high performance implementation of the Common Lisp
  programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
  mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
  sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
  interface; an implementation of CLOS; the Common Lisp Object System;
  which includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol; a source-level
  debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor implemented in
  Common Lisp. CMUCL is maintained by a team of volunteers collaborating
  over the Internet, and is in the public domain.


=== Installation instructions ==========================================

  For each supported platform there are two gzipped tar archives, one
  containing the base system, and the other (with extra in the name)
  containing optional additional files supporting CLX, Hemlock, Gray
  streams and so on.
  
  For the Solaris/SPARC platform, the release binaries should work with
  SunOS 5.5, 5.7 and 5.8 (also known respectively as Solaris 2.5,
  Solaris 7 and Solaris 8). If you have an UltraSPARC processor you can
  get the v9 binaries, which use instructions which are only present on
  SPARC-v9 implementations; otherwise you should get the binaries
  without v9 in the name of the tarball. If you have an UltraSPARC the
  command uname -m will say sun4u, if you have an older machine such as
  a SparcStation it will probably say sun4m.
  
  Download the gzipped tar archives corresponding to your platform. You
  can check the integrity of the files you have downloaded by comparing
  the output of md5sum <filename> with that given in the file
  md5sums.txt.
  
  The release tarballs extract to the following directory structure:
  
     bin/lisp
     lib/cmucl/lib/lisp.core
     doc/cmucl/README (this file)
     man/man1/cmucl.1
     ...
  
  This allows you to install CMUCL directly under /usr/local, for
  example using
  
     cd /usr/local
     tar xzf /path/to/cmucl-18d-<platform>.tar.gz
     
  or alternatively, install under a directory in /opt, for example
  
     mkdir /opt/cmucl-18d
     cd /opt/cmucl-18d
     tar xzf /path/to/cmucl-18d-<platform>.tar.gz
  
  In the second case you will need to create a shell script to invoke
  CMUCL. Copy the file /opt/cmucl-18d/bin/sample-wrapper to a directory
  in your PATH (naming it cmucl for example), and replace both
  occurrences of <<your-cmucl-path>> by /opt/cmucl-18d. Make sure that
  this shell script is executable (using "chmod +x scriptname").
  
  You can now invoke CMUCL: this should display a banner then show a
  prompt (the default prompt is an asterisk).
  
     % cmucl
     CMU Common Lisp 18d, running on myhost
     See <URL:http://www.cons.org/cmucl/support.html> for information.
     Loaded subsystems:
        Python 1.0, target SPARCstation/Solaris 2
        CLOS based on PCL version:  September 16 92 PCL (f)
     * (format t "~&Hello, world!~%")
     Hello, world!
     NIL
     * 
  
  You may wish to edit your site initialization file (in
  /usr/local/lib/cmucl/site-init.lisp).

   documentation and tips on using CMUCL, and information regarding
   mailing lists and bug reporting.
