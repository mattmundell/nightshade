.SH NAME
lisp \- CMU Common Lisp programming environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lisp
[input-files] [switch-list]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I lisp
Starts up CMU Common Lisp.  If
.I switch-list
is empty, then Lisp will enter a read-eval-print loop using stdin, stdout and
stderr.  The optional 
.I input-files
provide operands for some switches.  These switches are defined:

.TP 10n
.BR \-core " filename"
Specifies the suspended Lisp image (or `core file') to start up.  The default
is `lib/lisp.core'.
.TP
.BR \-edit
Causes Lisp to enter the 
.I Hemlock
editor.
A file to edit may be specified by
placing the name of the file between the program name (usually `lisp') and
the first switch.
.TP
.BR \-eval " expression"
Evaluates the specified Lisp
.I expression
during the start up sequence.  The value of the form will not be printed unless
it is wrapped in a form that does output.
.TP
.BR \-init " filename"
Specifies the name of a file containing user customizations that is to be
loaded each time Lisp starts up (default ~/init or ~/.cmucl-init.)  The loader
loads any existing compiled binary, or the ".lisp" source if none.
.TP
.BR \-hinit " filename"
Similar to \-init, but specifies the name of the
.I Hemlock
init file (default `~/hemlock-init' or ~/.hemlock-init), which is loaded only
when
.I Hemlock
is started.
.TP
.BR \-noinit
Suppresses loading of the init file, and also prevents \-edit from loading the
.I Hemlock
init file.
.TP
.BR \-nositeinit
Suppresses loading of the site-init site specific initialization file.
.TP
.BR \-load " filename"
Loads the specified file into Lisp before entering Lisp's read-eval-print loop.
.TP
.BR \-slave " editor-name"
Specifies that Lisp should start up as a 
.I slave
Lisp and try to
connect to an editor Lisp.  The name of the editor to connect to must be
specified.  To find the editor's name, use the
.I Hemlock
`Accept Slave Connections' command.  
.I editor-name
is of the form `machine-name:socket', where
.I machine-name 
is the
internet host name for the machine and
.I socket
is the decimal number of the socket to connect to.
.PP

.SH ENVIRONMENT

.TP 10n
.BR CMUCLLIB
This variable points to the `lib/' directory holding `lisp.core' and other
files used by Lisp at run-time.  The default is `/usr/local/lib/cmucl/lib'.
.TP
.BR CMUCL_EMPTYFILE
[SunOS only] If `df /tmp' shows `swap' as the filesystem for the `/tmp'
directory, then you have a "tmpfs" filesystem.  In this case, you must setenv
CMUCL_EMPTYFILE to point into a pathname on a non-TMPFS filesystem that can be
used instead of `/tmp/empty'.
.TP
.BR XKEYSYMDB
In order to use Motif (and the graphical debugger) with X servers from
non-OSF vendors (like Sun) you may need to set the environment variable
XKEYSYMDB to point to the file `lib/XKeysymDB'.  Otherwise, you will get many
error messages every time a new connection is opened to the CMU CL motifd.
This file is read by the X11R5 Xt in order to augment the keysym database with
certain OSF vendor keysyms that Motif wants to use.

.SH FILES

The following pathnames are specified relative to the directory where CMU CL is
installed, e.g. /usr/local.

.TP 10n
.BR doc/cmucl/*
Various postscript and text documentation files.
.TP
.BR bin/lisp
The lisp startup program.  This directory should be in PATH.

.TP
.BR lib/cmucl/lib/XKeysymDB
Database of X Keysym names for Motif.
.TP
.BR lib/cmucl/lib/load-foreign.csh
Script used by LOAD-FOREIGN to run "ld" on some platforms.
.TP
.BR ~/init.lisp,~/.cmucl-init.lisp

.SH BUGS

Consult http://www.cons.org/cmucl/support.html for support
information, including mechanisms for bug reporting.  Please consult
your local CMU CL maintainer or Common Lisp expert if any to verify
that a problem really is a bug before reporting it.

Known problems with this version:
.TP 3
--
Detection of stack overflow is not very graceful.   You get many "map
failure" errors on stderr.
.TP 3
--
If file descriptors are used up, then Lisp will die.
.TP 3
\--
Several proposed ANSI Common Lisp (CLtL II) features are not implemented:
Any CLOS features not implemented by PCL, and features added since the first
ANSI draft.
.TP 3
\--
The interpreter's pre-processing freezes in the macro definitions in effect at
the time an interpreted function is defined.
