.AT 3
.SH NAME
nightshade \- Lisp environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nightshade
[input-files] [switch-list]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I nightshade
starts up the Nightshade Lisp environment.  If
.I switch-list
is empty, then Nightshade will enter a read-eval-print loop using
stdin, stdout and stderr.  The optional
.I input-files
provide operands for some switches.  These switches are defined:
.
.TP 10n
.BR \-core " filename"
Specifies the suspended image (or `core file') to start up.  The default
is `lib/lisp.core'.
.TP
.BR \-edit
Causes Nightshade to enter the editor.
A file to edit may be specified by
placing the name of the file between the program name (usually `nightshade') and
the first switch.
.TP
.BR \-eval " expression"
Evaluates the specified Lisp
.I expression
during the start up sequence.  The value of the form will only be printed if
it is wrapped in a form that does output.
.TP
.BR \-init " filename"
Specifies the name of a file containing user customizations to be
loaded each time Nightshade starts up (default ~/nightshade.lisp or ~/.nightshade.lisp).
The loader
loads any existing compiled versions of these files, else the source.
.TP
.BR \-einit " filename"
Similar to \-init, but specifies the name of the editor
init file (default `~/nightshade-ed.lisp' or ~/.nightshade-ed.lisp), which is loaded only
when the editor is started.
.TP
.BR \-noinit
Suppresses loading of the init file, and also prevents \-edit from loading the
editor init file.
.TP
.BR \-load " filename"
Loads the specified file into Nightshade before entering the read-eval-print loop.
.TP
.BR \-slave " editor-name"
Specifies that Lisp should start up as a
.I slave
Lisp and try to
connect to an editor Lisp.  The name of the editor to connect to must be
specified.  To find the editor's name, use the editor
`Accept Slave Connections' command.
.I editor-name
is of the form `machine-name:socket', where
.I machine-name
is the
internet host name for the machine and
.I socket
is the decimal number of the socket to connect to.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.\"
.TP 10n
.BR NIGHTSHADELIB
This variable points to the `lib/' directory holding `lisp.core' and other
files used by Lisp at run-time.  The default is `/usr/local/lib/nightshade/lib'.
.\" .TP
.\" .BR CMUCL_EMPTYFILE
.\" [SunOS only] If `df /tmp' shows `swap' as the filesystem for the `/tmp'
.\" directory, then you have a "tmpfs" filesystem.  In this case, you must setenv
.\" CMUCL_EMPTYFILE to point into a pathname on a non-TMPFS filesystem that can be
.\" used instead of `/tmp/empty'.
.\" .TP
.\" .BR XKEYSYMDB
.\" In order to use Motif (and the graphical debugger) with X servers from
.\" non-OSF vendors (like Sun) you may need to set the environment variable
.\" XKEYSYMDB to point to the file `lib/XKeysymDB'.  Otherwise, you will get many
.\" error messages every time a new connection is opened to the CMU CL motifd.
.\" This file is read by the X11R5 Xt in order to augment the keysym database with
.\" certain OSF vendor keysyms that Motif wants to use.
