  Made FEEBS bind, instead of set, *single-step*,*delay*,
  *feep-dead-feebs*, and *continue*.  These values were being retained
  between runs.

  Fixed X interaction by calling X:OPEN-CONSOLE in INIT-GRAPHICS.  Also,
  set bordercolor and background parameters in INIT-GRAPHICS.  Made
  KILL-FEEB look at the value of *feep-dead-feebs*.

  Written by Skef and Scott.  This is just a file of sample feebs that are
  pretty dumb.

  Created by Jim Healy, July 1987.  This file contains some sample mazes
  with various curious properties.

  No time stamp for this either, but it is close to the previous line's.

  ;;; Modifications by Jim Healy:
  ;;;
  ;;; Ported the graphics to the IBM RT PC using the X window manager.
  ;;; Added functions to create and store bitmaps for X.
  ;;; Added event-handling routines to catch incoming events from the
  ;;;   X server and redisplay the windows if exposed.
  ;;; Changed :single-step option to work by clicking a mouse button.
  ;;; Added keypress features to quit the game prematurely (q), jump
  ;;;   into single-step mode (s), and go back to automatic mode (a).
  ;;; Added the neat "Planet of the Feebs" banner at the top.
  ;;; Added feature to zap windows at end of game by clicking a mouse
  ;;;   button.
  ;;; Fixed the disembodied periscopes bug.

  ;;; The following by Scott Fahlman, for initial public release:
  ;;;
  ;;; Installed CHANCE macro to speed up random events. 
  ;;; Modified points for being killed from -5 to -2. 
  ;;; When you zap yourself, you get no points for the kill.
  ;;; Eliminated random length of game.  Now *GAME-LENGTH* = 1000.
  ;;; Modified default maze slightly so that no two entry points are
  ;;;   line of sight, regardless of how the feebs are facing.
  ;;; Changed directions from keywords to constants, with integer values:
  ;;;   north = 1, east = 2, etc.
  ;;; Randomize initial entry points for feebs.
  ;;; Display more interesting stuff in text area: score, energy, last move.
  ;;; Keep energy in range 0 to 200 always, fix bug that caused any eating
  ;;;   to push energy to maximum.
  ;;; Display kills in status area, along with score.
  ;;; ABORTED status field was not being maintained.
  ;;; Install a smoother function for aborting moves of slow feebs.
  ;;; Add single-step and slow motion.
  ;;; Put in proximity sense, start vision array in space in front of the
  ;;;   the feeb's current location, going forward, left, or right from there.
  ;;; Store the appropriate image list in each maze cell, eliminating the
  ;;;   IMAGIFY operations.  Add a pointer from the feeb-image back to the
  ;;;   full feeb-structure.
  ;;; Allow *maze-i-size* and *maze-j-size* to be different.
  ;;; Fixed a couple of bugs in fireball motion.
  ;;; Feebs running into fireballs get zapped.
  ;;; Make sure image is updated between action and redisplay.
  ;;; Queue redisplay for a feeb's old square on every move.
  ;;; Improve mushroom image to not hit edges of square.
  ;;; Improve fireball display to show direction of travel.
  ;;; On reflection, update fireball DIRECTION as well as DI, DJ.
  ;;; Display current turn.  Improve kludgy number printing.
  ;;; Display periscope-like appendage when feeb is peeking.
  ;;; Do not execute peek command if the feeb is facing a rock wall.
  ;;; When a feeb was peeking last move, queue the forward square for
  ;;;   redisplay to get rid of the periscope.
  ;;; Set up auto-feeb creation and add some stupid auto-feebs.
  ;;; Remove the terse printing function for the status structure to make
  ;;;   it somewhat easier to debug things.
  ;;; Fixed a bug in the DI and DJ macros.
