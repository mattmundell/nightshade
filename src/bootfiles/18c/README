This directory holds any special "boot" files needed to get from some delta
to the next. The directory src/bootfiles/18c holds files generated post 18c
release.

The files will be named boot1.lisp, boot2.lisp, ..., bootz.lisp. Each file
should have some commentary as to the particulars about the file.  It is
hoped, but not guaranteed, that one could load all files into a fresh 18c
or nearly current environment and be able to compile current sources.
