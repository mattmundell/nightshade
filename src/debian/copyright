    As of version 1b Nightshade is most probably entirely public domain.  It is
    based on CMUCL 18c.

    All parts of CMUCL 18c that were explicitly marked as copyrighted have been
    removed.  This includes PCL, the CLX interface, the MIT version of the loop
    macro and some of the contrib directory.

    Everyone who committed to the CMUCL 18c repository after the CMU public
    domain release has confirmed that the additions they made are public
    domain.  They are Douglas Crosher (dtc), Robert MacLachlan (ram) and Paul
    Werkowski (pw).

    Contributions committed on behalf of the contributor after the CMU public
    domain release were recorded in the CVS logs.  The status of these
    additions is:

      % confirmed public domain by contributor

	Marco Antoniotti, Julian Dolby, Peter Van Eynde, Fred Gilham, Erica
	Marsden, Mike McDonald, Timothy Miller, Tim Moore, Ken Olum, Raymond
	Toy.

      % reverted

	Pierpaolo Bernardi, Casper Dik, Pierre Mai, Juergen Weiss.

      % pending contact with the author

	Casper Dik, Marcus Krummenacker, Simon.

    Every new addition to the CMUCL 18c base is public domain.  A few of these
    new additions come from outside the Nightshade project; their sources are
    detailed in the file src/etc/AUTHORS.
