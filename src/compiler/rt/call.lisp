;;; DEFAULT-UNKNOWN-VALUES  --  Internal.
;;;
;;; Emit code needed at the return-point from an unknown-values call to get or
;;; default a desired, fixed number of values.  Values is the head of the
;;; TN-Ref list for the locations that the values are to be received into.
;;; Nvals is the number of values that are to be received (should equal the
;;; length of Values).
;;;
;;; Move-Temp is a Descriptor-Reg TNs used as a temporary.
;;;
;;; This code exploits the fact that in the unknown-values convention, a single
;;; value return returns at the return PC + 4, whereas a return of other than
;;; one value returns directly at the return PC.
;;;
;;; If 0 or 1 values are expected, then we just emit an instruction to reset
;;; the SP (which will only be executed when other than 1 value is returned.)
;;;
;;; In the general case, we have to do three things:
;;;  -- Default unsupplied register values.  This need only be done when a
;;;     single value is returned, since register values are defaulted by the
;;;     called in the non-single case.
;;;  -- Default unsupplied stack values.  This needs to be done whenever there
;;;     are stack values.
;;;  -- Reset SP.  This must be done whenever other than 1 value is returned,
;;;     regardless of the number of values desired.
;;;
;;; The general-case code looks like this:
#|

	cau a1 0 nil-16			; Default register values
	...
	loadi nargs 1			; Force defaulting of stack values

;;; Define-Full-Call  --  Internal.
;;;
;;;    This macro helps in the definition of full call VOPs by avoiding code
;;; replication in defining the cross-product VOPs.
;;;
;;; Name is the name of the VOP to define.
;;; 
;;; Named is true if the first argument is a symbol whose global function
;;; definition is to be called.
;;;
;;; Return is either :Fixed, :Unknown or :Tail:
;;; -- If :Fixed, then the call is for a fixed number of values, returned in
;;;    the standard passing locations (passed as result operands).
;;; -- If :Unknown, then the result values are pushed on the stack, and the
;;;    result values are specified by the Start and Count as in the
;;;    unknown-values continuation representation.
;;; -- If :Tail, then do a tail-recursive call.  No values are returned.
;;;    The Old-Fp and Return-PC are passed as the second and third arguments.
;;;
;;; In non-tail calls, the pointer to the stack arguments is passed as the last
;;; fixed argument.  If Variable is false, then the passing locations are
;;; passed as a more arg.  Variable is true if there are a variable number of
;;; arguments passed on the stack.  Variable cannot be specified with :Tail
;;; return.  TR variable argument call is implemented separately.
;;;
;;; When variable is false, the compiler actually has already invoked VOP's to
;;; explicitly move arguments into their passing locations.  Hence the VOP
;;; argument args (which is :more t) is actually ignored.  We pass it into the
;;; call VOP's for lifetime analysis, and the TN references it represents stand
;;; in at the call site for the references to those TN's where the callee
;;; actually reads them.
;;;
;;; In tail call with fixed arguments, the passing locations are passed as a
;;; more arg, but there is no new-FP, since the arguments have been set up in
;;; the current frame.
