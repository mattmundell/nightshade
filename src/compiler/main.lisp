;;; to do anything.
;;;
;;; If the constant hasn't been dumped, then we check to see if we are in the
;;; process of creating it.  We detect this by maintaining the special
;;; *constants-being-created* as a list of all the constants we are in the
;;; process of creating.  Actually, each entry is a list of the constant and
;;; any init forms that need to be processed on behalf of that constant.
;;;
;;; It's not necessarily an error for this to happen.  If we are processing the
;;; init form for some object that showed up *after* the original reference
;;; to this constant, then we just need to defer the processing of that init
;;; form.  To detect this, we maintain *constants-created-since-last-init* as
;;; a list of the constants created since the last time we started processing
;;; an init form.  If the constant passed to emit-make-load-form shows up in
;;; this list, then there is a circular chain through creation forms, which is
;;; an error.
;;;
;;; If there is some intervening init form, then we blow out of processing it
;;; by throwing to the tag PENDING-INIT.  The value we throw is the entry from
;;; *constants-being-created*.  This is so the offending init form can be
;;; tacked onto the init forms for the circular object.
;;;
;;; If the constant doesn't show up in *constants-being-created*, then we have
;;; to create it.  We call MAKE-LOAD-FORM and check to see if the creation
;;; form is the magic value :just-dump-it-normally.  If it is, then we don't
;;; do anything.  The dumper will eventually get it's hands on the object
;;; and use the normal structure dumping noise on it.
;;;
;;; Otherwise, we bind *constants-being-created* and *constants-created-since-
;;; last-init* and compile the creation form a la load-time-value.  When this
;;; finishes, we tell the dumper to use that result instead whenever it sees
;;; this constant.
;;;
;;; Now we try to compile the init form.  We bind *constants-created-since-
;;; last-init* to NIL and compile the init form (and any init forms that were

  "Compiles Source, producing a corresponding .FASL file.  Source may be a list
   of files, in which case the files are compiled as a unit, producing a single
   .FASL file.  The output file names are defaulted from the first (or only)
   input file name.  Other options available via keywords:
   :Output-File
      The name of the fasl to output, NIL for none, T for the default.
   :Error-File
      The name of the error listing file, NIL for none (the default), T for
      .err.
   :Trace-File
      If specified, internal data structures are dumped to this file.  T for
      the .trace default.
   :Error-Output
      If a stream, then error output is sent there as well as to the listing
      file.  NIL suppresses this additional error output.  The default is T,
      which means use *ERROR-OUTPUT*.
   :Block-Compile {NIL | :SPECIFIED | T}
      Determines whether multiple functions are compiled together as a unit,
      resolving function references at compile time.  NIL means that global
      function names are never resolved at compilation time.  :SPECIFIED means
      that names are resolved at compile-time when convenient (as in a
      self-recursive call), but the compiler doesn't combine top-level DEFUNs.
      With :SPECIFIED, an explicit START-BLOCK declaration will enable block
      compilation.  A value of T indicates that all forms in the file(s) should
      be compiled as a unit.  The default is the value of
      EXT:*BLOCK-COMPILE-DEFAULT*, which is initially :SPECIFIED.
   :Entry-Points
      This specifies a list of function names for functions in the file(s) that
      must be given global definitions.  This only applies to block
      compilation, and is useful mainly when :BLOCK-COMPILE T is specified on a
      file that lacks START-BLOCK declarations.  If the value is NIL (the
      default) then all functions will be globally defined.
   :Byte-Compile {T | NIL | :MAYBE}
      Determines whether to compile into interpreted byte code instead of
      machine instructions.  Byte code is several times smaller, but much
      slower.  If :MAYBE, then only byte-compile when SPEED is 0 and
      DEBUG <= 1.  The default is the value of EXT:*BYTE-COMPILE-DEFAULT*,
      which is initially :MAYBE."
