;;; This annotates continuations, lambda-vars, and lambdas.  For each
;;; continuation, we cache how its destination uses its value.  This only buys
;;; efficiency when the code executes more than once, but the overhead of this
;;; part of the prepass for code executed only once should be negligible.
;;;
;;; As a special case to aid interpreting local function calls, we sometimes
;;; note the continuation as :unused.  This occurs when there is a local call,
;;; and there is no actual function object to call; we mark the continuation as
;;; :unused since there is nothing to push on the interpreter's stack.
;;; Normally we would see a reference to a function that we would push on the
;;; stack to later pop and apply to the arguments on the stack.  To determine
;;; when we have a local call with no real function object, we look at the node
;;; to see if it is a reference with a destination that is a :local combination
;;; whose function is the reference node's continuation.
;;;
;;; After checking for virtual local calls, we check for funny functions the
;;; compiler refers to for calling to note certain operations.  These functions
;;; are undefined, and if the interpreter tried to reference the function cells
;;; of these symbols, it would get an error.  We mark the continuations
;;; delivering the values of these references as :unused, so the reference
;;; never takes place.
;;;
;;; For each lambda-var, including a lambda's vars and its let's vars, we note
;;; the stack offset used to access and store that variable.  Then we note the
;;; lambda with the total number of variables, so we know how big its stack
;;; frame is.  Also in the lambda's info is the number of its arguments that it
;;; actually references; the interpreter never pushes or pops an unreferenced
;;; argument, so we can't just use LENGTH on LAMBDA-VARS to know how many args
;;; the caller passed.
;;;
;;; For each entry node in a lambda, we associate in the lambda-eval-info the
;;; entry node with a stack offset.  Evaluation code stores the frame pointer
;;; in this slot upon processing the entry node to aid stack cleanup and
;;; correct frame manipulation when processing exit nodes.
