#[ Assembly

    Resolve branches and convert into object code and fixup information.

Phase position: 22/23 (back)

Presence: required

Files: codegen

Entry functions: `new-assem:finalize-segment'

Call sequences:

    native-compile-component
      generate-code
        new-assem:finalize-segment
          new-assem:compress-output
          new-assem:finalize-positions
          new-assem:process-back-patches


In effect, we do much of the work of assembly when the compiler is compiled.

The assembler makes one pass fixing up branch offsets, then squeezes out the
space left by branch shortening and dumps out the code along with the load-time
fixup information.  The assembler also deals with dumping unboxed non-immediate
constants and symbols.  Boxed constants are created by explicit constructor
code in the top-level form, while immediate constants are generated using
inline code.

    XXX The basic output of the assembler is:
	A code vector
	A representation of the fixups along with indices into the code vector for
	  the fixup locations
	A PC map translating PCs into source paths

        This information can then be used to build an output file or an in-core
        function object.

The assembler is table-driven and supports arbitrary instruction formats.  As
far as the assembler is concerned, an instruction is a bit sequence that is
broken down into subsequences.  Some of the subsequences are constant in value,
while others can be determined at assemble or load time.

Assemble Node Form*
    Allow instructions to be emitted during the evaluation of the Forms by
    defining Inst as a local macro.  This macro caches various global
    information in local variables.  Node tells the assembler what node
    ultimately caused this code to be generated.  This is used to create the
    pc=>source map for the debugger.

Assemble-Elsewhere Node Form*
    Similar to Assemble, but the current assembler location is changed to
    somewhere else.  This is useful for generating error code and similar
    things.  Assemble-Elsewhere may not be nested.

Inst Name Arg*
    Emit the instruction Name with the specified arguments.

Gen-Label
Emit-Label (Label)
    Gen-Label returns a Label object, which describes a place in the code.
    Emit-Label marks the current position as being the location of Label.

#[ Writing Assembly Code

VOP writers expect:
   MOVE
      You write when you port the assembler.
   EMIT-LABEL
      Assembler interface like INST.  Takes a label you made and says "stick it
      here."
   GEN-LABEL
      Returns a new label suitable for use with EMIT-LABEL exactly once and
      for referencing as often as necessary.
   INST
      Recognizes and dispatches to instructions you defined for assembler.
   ALIGN
      This takes the number of zero bits you want in the low end of the address
      of the next instruction.
   ASSEMBLE
   ASSEMBLE-ELSEWHERE
      Get ready for assembling stuff.  Takes a VOP and arbitrary PROGN-style
      body.  Wrap these around instruction emission code announcing the first
      pass of our assembler.
   CURRENT-NFP-TN
      This returns a TN for the NFP if the caller uses the number stack, or
      nil.
   SB-ALLOCATED-SIZE
      This returns the size of some storage based used by the currently
      compiling component.
   ...

;;; VOP idioms
;;;

STORE-STACK-TN
LOAD-STACK-TN
   These move a value from a register to the control stack, or from the
   control stack to a register.  They take care of checking the TN types,
   modifying offsets according to the address units per word, etc.
]#

#[ Pipeline Reorganization

    On some machines, move memory references backward in the code so that
    they can overlap with computation.  On machines with delayed branch
    instructions, locate instructions that can be moved into delay slots.
