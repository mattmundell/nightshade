;;; Entry-Analyze  --  Interface
;;;
;;;    This phase runs before IR2 conversion, initializing each XEP's
;;; Entry-Info structure.  We call the VM-supplied Select-Component-Format
;;; function to make VM-dependent initializations in the IR2-Component.  This
;;; includes setting the IR2-Component-Kind and allocating fixed implementation
;;; overhead in the constant pool.  If there was a forward reference to a
;;; function, then the ENTRY-INFO will already exist, but will be
;;; uninitialized.
;;;

			(setf (leaf-info fun) (make-entry-info)))))

;;; REPLACE-TOP-LEVEL-XEPS  --  Interface
;;;
;;;    Replace all references to Component's non-closure XEPS that appear in
;;; top-level components, changing to :TOP-LEVEL-XEP functionals.  If the
;;; cross-component ref is not in a :TOP-LEVEL component, or is to a closure,
;;; then substitution is suppressed.
;;;
;;; When a cross-component ref is not substituted, we return T to indicate that
;;; early deletion of this component's IR1 should not be done.  We also return
;;; T if this component contains :TOP-LEVEL lambdas (though it is not a
;;; :TOP-LEVEL component.)
;;;
;;; We deliberately don't use the normal reference deletion, since we don't
;;; want to trigger deletion of the XEP (although it shouldn't hurt, since this
;;; is called after Component is compiled.)  Instead, we just clobber the
;;; REF-LEAF.
