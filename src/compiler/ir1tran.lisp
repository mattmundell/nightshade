;;; IR1-Top-Level  --  Interface
;;;
;;;    This function takes a form and the top-level form number for that form,
;;; and returns a lambda representing the translation of that form in the
;;; current global environment.  The lambda is top-level lambda that can be
;;; called to cause evaluation of the forms.  This lambda is in the initial
;;; component.  If For-Value is T, then the value of the form is returned from
;;; the function, otherwise NIL is returned.
;;;
;;;    This function may have arbitrary effects on the global environment due
;;; to processing of Proclaims and Eval-Whens.  All syntax error checking is
;;; done, with erroneous forms being replaced by a proxy which signals an error
;;; if it is evaluated.  Warnings about possibly inconsistent or illegal
;;; changes to the global environment will also be given.
;;;
;;;    We make the initial component and convert the form in a progn (and an
;;; optional NIL tacked on the end.)  We then return the lambda.  We bind all
;;; of our state variables here, rather than relying on the global value (if
;;; any) so that IR1 conversion will be reentrant.  This is necessary for
;;; eval-when processing, etc.

;;; IR1-Convert-Hairy-Args  --  Internal
;;;
;;;    This function generates the entry point functions for the
;;; optional-dispatch Res.  We accomplish this by recursion on the list of
;;; arguments, analyzing the arglist on the way down and generating entry
;;; points on the way up.
;;;
;;;    Default-Vars is a reversed list of all the argument vars processed so
;;; far, including supplied-p vars.  Default-Vals is a list of the names of the
;;; Default-Vars.
;;;
;;;    Entry-Vars is a reversed list of processed argument vars, excluding
;;; supplied-p vars.  Entry-Vals is a list things that can be evaluated to get
;;; the values for all the vars from the Entry-Vars.  It has the var name for
;;; each required or optional arg, and has T for each supplied-p arg.
;;;
;;;    Vars is a list of the Lambda-Var structures for arguments that haven't
;;; been processed yet.  Supplied-p-p is true if a supplied-p argument has
;;; already been processed; only in this case are the Default-XXX and Entry-XXX
;;; different.
;;;
;;;    The result at each point is a lambda which should be called by the above
;;; level to default the remaining arguments and evaluate the body.  We cause
;;; the body to be evaluated by converting it and returning it as the result
;;; when the recursion bottoms out.
;;;
;;;    Each level in the recursion also adds its entry point function to the
;;; result Optional-Dispatch.  For most arguments, the defaulting function and
;;; the entry point function will be the same, but when supplied-p args are
;;; present they may be different.
;;;
;;;     When we run into a rest or keyword arg, we punt out to
;;; IR1-Convert-More, which finishes for us in this case.

;;;
;;;    This is somewhat involved, since a type assertion may only be made on a
