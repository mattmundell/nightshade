;;; at the very end of IR1.  If a type check is too complex for the back end to

;;;  -- Not checkable by the back end, but checkable via an explicit test in
;;;     type check conversion (:HAIRY), or
;;;  -- not reasonably checkable at all (:TOO-HAIRY).
;;;
;;; A type is checkable if it either represents a fixed number of values (as
;;; determined by VALUES-TYPES), or it is the assertion for an MV-Bind.  A type
;;; is simply checkable if all the type assertions have a TYPE-CHECK-TEMPLATE.
;;; In this :SIMPLE case, the second value is a list of the type restrictions
;;; specified for the leading positional values.
;;;
;;; We force a check to be hairy even when there are fixed values if we are in
;;; a context where we may be forced to use the unknown values convention
;;; anyway.  This is because IR2tran can't generate type checks for unknown
;;; values continuations but people could still be depending on the check being
;;; done.  We only care about EXIT and RETURN (not MV-COMBINATION) since these
;;; are the only contexts where the ultimate values receiver 
;;;
;;; In the :HAIRY case, the second value is a list of triples of the form:
;;;    (Not-P Type Original-Type)
;;;
;;; If true, the Not-P flag indicates a test that the corresponding value is
;;; *not* of the specified Type.  Original-Type is the type asserted on this
;;; value in the continuation, for use in error messages.  When Not-P is true,
;;; this will be different from Type.
;;;
;;; This allows us to take what has been proven about Cont's type into
;;; consideration.  If it is cheaper to test for the difference between the
;;; derived type and the asserted type, then we check for the negation of this
;;; type instead.
;;;
;;; When the proven type represents an unknown number of values, but Cont's
;;; destination receives only a single value, a :hairy type check is
