;;;; Full call.
;;;
;;;    There is something of a cross-product effect with full calls.  Different
;;; versions are used depending on whether we know the number of arguments or
;;; the name of the called function, and whether we want fixed values, unknown
;;; values, or a tail call.
;;;
;;; In full call, the arguments are passed creating a partial frame on the
;;; stack top and storing stack arguments into that frame.  On entry to the
;;; callee, this partial frame is pointed to by FP.

;;; Define-Full-Call  --  Internal
;;;
;;;    This macro helps in the definition of full call VOPs by avoiding code
;;; replication in defining the cross-product VOPs.
;;;
;;; Name is the name of the VOP to define.
;;;
;;; Named is true if the first argument is an fdefinition object whose
;;; definition is to be called.
;;;
;;; Return is either :Fixed, :Unknown or :Tail:
;;; -- If :Fixed, then the call is for a fixed number of values, returned in
;;;    the standard passing locations (passed as result operands).
;;; -- If :Unknown, then the result values are pushed on the stack, and the
;;;    result values are specified by the Start and Count as in the
;;;    unknown-values continuation representation.
;;; -- If :Tail, then do a tail-recursive call.  No values are returned.
;;;    The Old-Fp and Return-PC are passed as the second and third arguments.
;;;
;;; In non-tail calls, the pointer to the stack arguments is passed as the last
;;; fixed argument.  If Variable is false, then the passing locations are
;;; passed as a more arg.  Variable is true if there are a variable number of
;;; arguments passed on the stack.  Variable cannot be specified with :Tail
;;; return.  TR variable argument call is implemented separately.
;;;
;;; In tail call with fixed arguments, the passing locations are passed as a
;;; more arg, but there is no new-FP, since the arguments have been set up in
;;; the current frame.
