;;;; INTERNAL-APPLY-LOOP macros.

;;; These macros are intimately related to INTERNAL-APPLY-LOOP.  They assume
;;; variables established by this function, and they assume they can return
;;; from a block by that name.  This is sleazy, but we justify it as follows:
;;; They are so specialized in use, and their invocation became lengthy, that
;;; we allowed them to slime some access to things in their expanding
;;; environment.  These macros don't really extend our Lisp syntax, but they do
;;; provide some template expansion service; it is these cleaner circumstance
;;; that require a more rigid programming style.
;;;
;;; Since these are macros expanded almost solely for c::combination nodes,
;;; they cascade from the end of this logical page to the beginning here.
;;; Therefore, it is best you start looking at them from the end of this
;;; section, backwards from normal scanning mode for Lisp code.
;;;

;;; DO-COMBINATION -- Internal.
;;;
;;; This runs a function on some arguments from the stack.  If the combination
;;; occurs in a tail recursive position, then we do the call such that we
;;; return from tail-p-function with whatever values the call produces.  With a
;;; :local call, we have to restore the stack to its previous frame before
;;; doing the call.  The :full call mechanism does this for us.  If it is NOT a
;;; tail recursive call, and we're in a multiple value context, then then push
;;; a list of the returned values.  Do the same thing if we're in a :return
;;; context.  Push a single value, without listifying it, for a :single value
;;; context.  Otherwise, just call for side effect.
;;;
;;; Node is the combination node, and cont is its continuation.  Frame-ptr
;;; is the current frame pointer, and closure is the current environment for
;;; closure variables.  Call-type is either :full or :local, and when it is
;;; local, lambda is the IR1 lambda to apply.
;;;
;;; This assumes the following variables are present: node, cont, frame-ptr,
;;; and closure.  It also assumes a block named internal-apply-loop.

;;;		     executing.  If the leaf's home environment is the same
;;;		     as the node's home environment, then the value is on the
;;;		     stack, else it's in the closure since it came from another
;;;		     environment.  Whether the var comes from the stack or the
;;;		     closure, it could have come from a closure, and it could
;;;		     have been closed over for setting.  When this happens, the
;;;		     actual value is stored in an indirection object, so
;;;		     indirect.  See COMPUTE-CLOSURE for the description of

;;; When a var has no references, the compiler computes IR1 such that the
;;; continuation delivering the value for the unreference var appears unused.

;;; saving it on the stack for binding, so we only pop a value when the var has
;;; some reference.  INTERNAL-APPLY uses this for c::combination nodes
;;; representing LET's.

;;; When storing the local, if it is indirect, then someone closes over it for
;;; setting instead of just for referencing.  We then store an indirection cell
;;; with the value, and the referencing code for locals knows how to get the
;;; actual value.

;;; down the vars list until we bottom out, storing values on the way back up
;;; the recursion.  You must do this instead of NREVERSE'ing the args list, so
;;; when we run out of values, we store nil's in the correct lambda-vars.
