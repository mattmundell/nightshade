;;;    The environment analysis phase for the compiler.  This phase annotates

;;; Environment-Analyze  --  Interface
;;;
;;;    Do environment analysis on the code in Component.  This involves various
;;; things:
;;;  1] Make an Environment structure for each non-let lambda, assigning the
;;;     lambda-environment for all lambdas.
;;;  2] Find all values that need to be closed over by each environment.
;;;  3] Scan the blocks in the component closing over non-local-exit
;;;     continuations.
;;;  4] Delete all non-top-level functions with no references.  This should
;;;     only get functions with non-NULL kinds, since normal functions are
;;;     deleted when their references go to zero.  If *byte-compiling*, then
;;;     don't delete optional entries with no references, since the byte
;;;     interpreter wants to call entries that the XEP doesn't.

;;; If a catch or an unwind-protect, then we set the Lexenv for the last node
